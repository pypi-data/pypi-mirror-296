# Dojo

[Compass Labs](https://compasslabs.ai/) ðŸ§­ developed Dojo, an agent-based DeFi simulation software operating at the EVM smart contract level.

---

## What can you do with dojo?

- Simulate the behavior of smart contracts in a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.
- Test your trading strategies on real code. Get detailed performance metrics.
- Seamlessy interact with multiple different protocols
- Visualize your results in a dashboard.

## What's coming next

- Switch from backtesting to live-execution. Check on/interact with your runner in real-time using a telegram bot.
- More protocols
- More dashboard - more fancy

## What makes dojo unique?

- Dojo executes the exact same code as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is therefore able to simulate the behavior of smart contracts with accuracy.
- With dojo, we abstract away solidity and allow you to interact with smart contracts using simple Python interfaces.
- We provide all historic data, you won't have to care about it at all.
- Dojo has a built-in dashboard to visualize your simulations.

## How to get started

We recommend working through our short tutorials to get started. You can find them [here](http://dojo.compasslabs.ai).  
If you have any feature request or bug report, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/CompassLabs/dojo_examples).
