However, their simulation is extremely challenging, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size, making it exceedingly difficult to parameterize the wave functions of large systems by using exact methods. Neural networks and machine learning in general are a way to face this challenge. For instance, methods like Tensor networks and Neural Quantum States are being investigated as promising tools to obtain the wave function of a quantum mechanical system. In this tutorial, we focus on a particularly promising class of deep learning algorithms. We explain how to construct a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) able to solve the Schrödinger equation for a given potential, by finding its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This technique is unsupervised, and utilizes a novel computational method in a manner that is barely explored. PINNs are a deep learning method that exploits Automatic Differentiation to solve Integro-Differential Equations in a mesh-free way. We show how to find both the ground and the excited states. The method discovers the states progressively by starting from the ground state. We explain how to introduce inductive biases in the loss to exploit further knowledge of the physical system. Such additional constraints allow for a faster and more accurate convergence. This technique can then be enhanced by a smart choice of collocation points in order to take advantage of the mesh-free nature of the PINN. The methods are made explicit by applying them to the infinite potential well and the particle in a ring, a challenging problem to be learned by anAIagentdue to the presence of complex-valued eigenfunctions and degenerate states.△ Less'}, {'Title': 'Domain Adaptable PrescriptiveAIAgentfor Enterprise', 'arXiv Link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20447', 'arXiv ID': 'arXiv:2407.20447[pdf,other]', 'Abstract': 'Despite advancements in causal inference and prescriptiveAI, its adoption in enterprise settings remains hindered primarily due to its technical complexity.

By incorporating emotional intelligence intoAIagents, their emotional stability can be evaluated to enhance their resilience and dependability in critical decision-making tasks. In this work, we develop a methodology for modeling psychological disorders using Reinforcement Learning (RL)agents. We utilized Appraisal theory to train RLagentsin a dynamic grid world environment with an Appraisal-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization (AG-PPO) algorithm. Additionally, we investigated numerous reward-shaping strategies to simulate psychological disorders and regulate the behavior of theagents. A comparison of various configurations of the modified PPO algorithm identified variants that simulate Anxiety disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)-like behavior inagents. Furthermore, we compared standard PPO with AG-PPO and its configurations, highlighting the performance improvement in terms of generalization capabilities. Finally, we conducted an analysis of theagents' behavioral patterns in complex test environments to evaluate the associated symptoms corresponding to the psychological disorders. Overall, our work showcases the benefits of the appraisal-guided PPO algorithm over the standard PPO algorithm and the potential to simulate psychological disorders in a controlled artificial environment and evaluate them on RLagents.△ Less\"}, {'Title': 'MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits DeepAISearcher', 'arXiv Link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20183', 'arXiv ID': 'arXiv:2407.20183[pdf,other]', 'Abstract': 'Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agentframework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agentdesign of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems. Besides, responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that MindSearch can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietaryAIsearch engine.△ Less'}, {'Title': 'Quantum Machine Learning Architecture Search via Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'arXiv Link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20147', 'arXiv ID': 'arXiv:2407.20147[pdf,other]', 'Abstract': \"The rapid advancement of quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has given rise to the burgeoning field of quantum machine learning (QML), aiming to capitalize on the strengths of quantum computing to propel ML forward. Despite its promise, crafting effective QML models necessitates profound expertise to strike a delicate balance between model intricacy and feasibility on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While complex models offer robust representation capabilities, their extensive circuit depth may impede seamless execution on extant noisy quantum platforms. In this paper, we address this quandary of QML model design by employing deep reinforcement learning to explore proficient QML model architectures tailored for designated supervised learning tasks. Specifically, our methodology involves training an RLagentto devise policies that facilitate the discovery of QML models without predetermined ansatz. Furthermore, we integrate an adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust the learning objectives, fostering continuous improvement in theagent'slearning process. Through extensive numerical simulations, we illustrate the efficacy of our approach within the realm of classification tasks. Our proposed method successfully identifies VQC architectures capable of achieving high classification accuracy while minimizing gate depth. This pioneering approach not only advances the study ofAI-driven quantum circuit design but also holds significant promise for enhancing performance in the NISQ era.△ Less\"}]",
