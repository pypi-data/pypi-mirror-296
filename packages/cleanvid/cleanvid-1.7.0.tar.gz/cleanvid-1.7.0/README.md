# cleanvid

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cleanvid)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cleanvid/) [![Docker Image](https://github.com/mmguero/cleanvid/workflows/cleanvid-build-push-ghcr/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mmguero/cleanvid/pkgs/container/cleanvid)

**cleanvid** is a little script to mute profanity in video files in a few simple steps:

1. The user provides as input a video file and matching `.srt` subtitle file. If subtitles are not provided explicitly, they will be extracted from the video file if possible; if not, [`subliminal`](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal) is used to attempt to download the best matching `.srt` file.
2. [`pysrt`](https://github.com/byroot/pysrt) is used to parse the `.srt` file, and each entry is checked against a [list](./src/cleanvid/swears.txt) of profanity or other words or phrases you'd like muted. Mappings can be provided (eg., map "sh*t" to "poop"), otherwise the word will be replaced with *****.
3. A new "clean" `.srt` file is created. with *only* those phrases containing the censored/replaced objectional language.
4. [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is used to create a cleaned video file. This file contains the original video stream, but the specified audio stream is muted during the segments containing objectional language. That audio stream is re-encoded and remultiplexed back together with the video. Optionally, the clean `.srt` file can be embedded in the cleaned video file as a subtitle track.

You can then use your favorite media player to play the cleaned video file together with the cleaned subtitles.

As an alternative to creating a new video file, cleanvid can create a simple EDL file (see the [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html) or KODI [documentation](https://kodi.wiki/view/Edit_decision_list)) or a custom JSON definition file for [PlexAutoSkip](https://github.com/mdhiggins/PlexAutoSkip).

**cleanvid** is part of a family of projects with similar goals:

* ðŸ“¼ [cleanvid](https://github.com/mmguero/cleanvid) for video files (using [SRT-formatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#Format) subtitles)
* ðŸŽ¤ [monkeyplug](https://github.com/mmguero/monkeyplug) for audio and video files (using either [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) or the [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/)-[API](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api) for speech recognition)
* ðŸ“• [montag](https://github.com/mmguero/montag) for ebooks
## Installation

Using `pip`, to install the latest [release from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cleanvid/):

```
python3 -m pip install -U cleanvid
```

Or to install directly from GitHub:


```
python3 -m pip install -U 'git+https://github.com/mmguero/cleanvid'
```

## Prerequisites

[cleanvid](./src/cleanvid/cleanvid.py) requires:

* Python 3
* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org)
* [babelfish](https://github.com/Diaoul/babelfish)
* [delegator.py](https://github.com/kennethreitz/delegator.py)
* [pysrt](https://github.com/byroot/pysrt)
* [subliminal](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal)

To install FFmpeg, use your operating system's package manager or install binaries from [ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). The Python dependencies will be installed automatically if you are using `pip` to install cleanvid.

### Docker

Alternately, a [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile) is provided to allow you to run cleanvid in Docker. You can build the `oci.guero.top/cleanvid:latest` Docker image with [`build_docker.sh`](./docker/build_docker.sh), then run [`cleanvid-docker.sh`](./docker/cleanvid-docker.sh) inside the directory where your video/subtitle files are located.
