## Streamline Your ADV Data Analysis

**ProADV** is a comprehensive Python package designed to empower researchers and engineers working with acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) data. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools for efficient cleaning, analysis, and visualization of ADV data, streamlining your workflow and extracting valuable insights from your measurements.

### Key Features

* **Despiking and Denoising:** ProADV tackles the challenge of spikes and noise in ADV data, providing a variety of robust algorithms for effective data cleaning. 
    * **Spike Detection:** 
        * **ACC (Acceleration Thresholding):** Identifies spikes based on exceeding a user-defined acceleration threshold.
        * **PST (Phase-Space Thresholding):** Utilizes a combination of velocity and its temporal derivative to detect spikes.
        * **mPST (Modified Phase-Space Thresholding):** An enhanced version of PST with improved sensitivity.
        * **VC (Velocity Correlation):** Detects spikes based on deviations from the correlation between neighboring data points.
        * **KDE (Kernel Density Estimation):** Employs a statistical approach to identify outliers based on the probability density function. 
        * **3d-KDE (Three-dimensional Kernel Density Estimation):** Extends KDE to three dimensions for more robust spike detection in complex data.
        * **m3d-KDE (Modified Three-dimensional Kernel Density Estimation):** Further refines 3d-KDE for enhanced performance.
    * **Replacement Methods:** ProADV offers several options to replace detected spikes with more reliable values:
        * **LVD (Last Valid Data):** Replaces spikes with the last valid data point before the spike.
        *  **MV (Mean Value):** Replaces spikes with the mean value of velocity component. 
        * **LI (Linear Interpolation):** Uses linear interpolation between surrounding points to estimate the missing value.
        * **12PP (12 Points Cubic Polynomial):** Employs a 12-point cubic polynomial to fit a smoother curve and replace spikes.

* **Statistical Analysis:** ProADV equips you with essential statistical tools to characterize your ADV data:
    * **Minimum, Maximum:** Provides the range of measured velocities.
    * **Mean, Median, Mode:** Calculates central tendency measures.
    * **Skewness, Kurtosis:** Analyzes the distribution characteristics of your data.

* **Advanced Analysis:** In addition to cleaning and basic statistics, ProADV offers advanced functionalities for deeper insights:
    * **Moving Average:** Smooths out data fluctuations for better visualization and trend analysis. Provided in simple moving average, exponential moving average, and weighted moving average methods. 
    * **SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis):** Extracts underlying patterns and trends from time series data.
    * **Kalman Filter:** Implements the Kalman filter algorithm for state estimation and prediction in time series data. 
    * **PR (Pollution Rate) Calculation:** Estimates the level of noise or pollution within the data.
    * **Spectral Analysis:**
        * **PSD (Power Spectral Density):** Analyzes the distribution of energy across different frequencies within the data.
        * **PDF (Probability Density Function):** Provides the probability of encountering specific velocity values.
    * **Normality Test:** Evaluate whether your data follows a normal distribution.
    * **Normalization:** Scales data to a common range for further analysis or visualization.
