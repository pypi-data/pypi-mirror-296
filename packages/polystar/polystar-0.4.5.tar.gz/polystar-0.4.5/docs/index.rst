======

You can use ``polystar`` to:

- access spacegroup and pointgroup symmetry operations
- determine the first Brillouin zone for a given real space crystallographic
  lattice
- find *an* irreducible Brillouin zone polyhedron for a lattice
- construct a polyhedron-filling connected-point network
- perform linear-interpolation of user-provided data for any reciprocal space
  point at a symmetry-equivalent position within the connected point network.
