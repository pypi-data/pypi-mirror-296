    "NOTE: We will NOT need to extract all keys from the HEC-RAS plan files.  We only need to toggle relevant settings, and provide a low-level function that can handle setting a single key by passing a full path.  We will build on top of that function to make specialized functions for each key that is important enough to warrant automation.  Each should have a docstring explaining the keys and how to set them, so the end user does not need to determine those details.   "

    "## Key Changes and Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. New sediment-related parameters: The updated file includes many new parameters related to sediment transport and modeling. This suggests that the sediment modeling capabilities have been expanded in Version 6.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Computational parameters: New parameters for time step control and computational methods have been added, indicating more fine-grained control over the simulation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 2D modeling parameters: Additional parameters for 2D modeling (e.g., UNET D2 parameters) suggest enhanced 2D modeling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Water quality parameters: Some water quality (WQ) parameters have been removed, while others remain. This might indicate a change in how water quality modeling is handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Output control: New parameters for controlling output formats and intervals have been added, suggesting more flexible output options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Revised Extraction Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maintain a dictionary of all of the relevant keys, including those from both versions.\n",
    "    - Have a separate function specifically to lookup keys in the plan file from a dictionary or by passing the key name. \n",
    "2. When parsing the file, check for the presence of each key and extract its value if present.\n",
    "3. For keys that may appear multiple times (e.g., 'Stage Flow Hydrograph'), collect all occurrences in a list.\n",
    "4. Use regular expressions for more complex parsing tasks, especially for keys with multiple values or specific formats.\n",
    "5. Implement version-specific parsing logic where necessary, based on the 'Program Version' value.\n",
    "6. Handle empty values consistently, either storing them as None or an empty string.\n",
    "7. For boolean flags (keys without values), store their presence as True in the dictionary.\n",
    "8. Implement error handling for unexpected formats or missing required keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Similarities Across Plan Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Structure: All plan types (steady, unsteady, 1D, and 2D) maintain a similar overall structure with key-value pairs.\n",
    "2. Common Keys: Many keys are shared across all plan types, including basic project information, computational parameters, and output settings.\n",
    "3. Version Consistency: The key structure remains consistent across different HEC-RAS versions, with differences primarily in values rather than key names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences in 2D Plans\n",
    "\n",
    "While 2D plans share many keys with 1D plans, they introduce several new keys and sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 2D Specific Keys:\n",
    "   - UNET D2 Name\n",
    "   - UNET D2 Cores\n",
    "   - UNET D2 SolverType\n",
    "   - UNET D2 Turbulence Formulation\n",
    "   - UNET D2 Smagorinsky Mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Breach Modeling Keys:\n",
    "   - Breach Loc (multiple entries)\n",
    "   - Breach Method\n",
    "   - Breach Geom\n",
    "   - Breach Start\n",
    "   - Breach Progression\n",
    "   - Simplified Physical Breach Downcutting\n",
    "   - Simplified Physical Breach Widening\n",
    "   - Mass Wasting Options\n",
    "   - Various DLBreach keys\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adaptive Hydraulics (ADH) Keys:\n",
    "   - ADH Filename\n",
    "   - ADH Link\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updated Extraction Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Key-Value Pairs:\n",
    "   - Create a dictionary to store all single key-value pairs.\n",
    "   - Populate this dictionary for all plan types (steady, unsteady, 1D, 2D).\n",
    "   - Handle empty values consistently, storing them as None or an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-Key Pairs (e.g., Boundary Conditions, Breach Locations):\n",
    "   - Use pandas DataFrames to store multi-key pairs.\n",
    "   - Create separate DataFrames for different types of multi-key data (e.g., one for boundary conditions, another for breach locations).\n",
    "   - Ensure the DataFrame structure can accommodate data from all plan types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plan Type Detection:\n",
    "   - Implement logic to detect the plan type (steady/unsteady, 1D/2D) based on the presence of specific keys.\n",
    "   - Use this detection to guide the extraction process, especially for 2D-specific keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Consistent Extraction Process:\n",
    "   - Use a single extraction function that can handle all plan types.\n",
    "   - Within this function, use conditional logic to handle plan-type-specific keys and sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Version Agnostic Approach:\n",
    "   - Design the extraction process to be version-agnostic, focusing on key names rather than specific values.\n",
    "   - Maintain a comprehensive list of all possible keys across versions and plan types.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Handling 2D-Specific Data:\n",
    "   - For 2D-specific sections (like breach data), create dedicated DataFrames or nested dictionaries to capture the hierarchical structure.\n",
    "   - Ensure that the extraction process can handle the repetitive nature of certain 2D-specific sections (e.g., multiple breach locations).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Error Handling and Logging:\n",
    "   - Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected key names or structures.\n",
    "   - Log any inconsistencies or unrecognized keys for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this updated strategy, we can create a flexible and comprehensive extraction process that handles all types of HEC-RAS plan files consistently, regardless of the simulation type or software version. The resulting data structure will provide easy access to both common and plan-specific parameters, facilitating further analysis and processing of HEC-RAS simulation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This revised strategy accounts for the changes in Version 6.5 while maintaining backward compatibility with earlier versions. It allows for flexible parsing of the plan file, accommodating both existing and potential future changes in the file structure."
