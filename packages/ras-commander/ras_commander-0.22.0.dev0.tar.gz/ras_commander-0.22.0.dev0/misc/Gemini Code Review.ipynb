    "### Function: `RasCommander.compute_plan`\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Docstring Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add an example to the docstring demonstrating the usage of the function. \n",
    "- Add clarity to the `compute_folder` argument: explain that the function will raise a ValueError if a folder path is provided that already exists. \n",
    "- Add a section to the docstring detailing the behavior when using a compute folder, including how a new `RasPrj` object is created. \n",
    "- Improve the description of the `plan_number` argument, explicitly mentioning that it can be either a string, a Path object, or the full path to a plan file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Improvements\n",
    "- **Remove redundant comments:**  Inline comments like `# This line of code is used to...` can be removed, as the code is self-explanatory. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization/Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "- The logic for determining `compute_plan_path` is duplicated for both the `if` and `else` branches. Consider refactoring this into a single block that executes regardless of `compute_folder`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Argument Naming\n",
    "\n",
    "- The arguments are named consistently with other functions in the library. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Code Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove debug statements**:  The function contains numerous `print` statements that are for debugging. \n",

Consider providing clearer guidance in the documentation and potentially adding safeguards to discourage mixing the two.\n",

    "- **`__init__`:**\n",
    "    - No issues. \n",

    "    - No issues.\n",
    "- **`_get_prj_entries`:**\n",
    "    - **Potential Optimization:** The code iterates through the entire `.prj` file for each entry type. Consider optimizing by parsing the file once and extracting all entry types simultaneously. \n",

    "    - No issues. \n",
    "- **`init_ras_project`:**\n",
    "    - **Redundant `print`:** The last print statement is commented out. Either uncomment it or remove it. \n",
    "- **`get_ras_exe`:**\n",
    "    - No major issues, but consider adding a check for newer versions of HEC-RAS beyond the ones listed in `ras_version_numbers`. \n",
