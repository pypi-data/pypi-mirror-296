## Standard Infuse/Withdraw Pump 11 Elite Programmable Syringe Pumps

The **Pump 11 Elite Series** represents the cutting edge in syringe pump technology, offering a comprehensive solution for a wide range of experimental needs. Designed to maintain the legacy of a premier infusion pump, the Elite Series combines user-friendly operation with a high-resolution touch screen, facilitating an intuitive icon-based interface. This allows researchers to effortlessly create, save, and execute both simple and complex infusion methods without needing a computer.

## Features

- **Versatile Syringe Compatibility:** The pumps feature a newly designed mechanism that securely clamps syringes ranging from 0.5 µl to 60 ml for a single syringe setup, and 0.5 µl to 10 ml for dual syringe configurations, ensuring reliable and consistent performance across a wide variety of syringe sizes.
- **Enhanced Flow Performance:** Offering flow rates from 1.28 picoliters per minute up to 88.28 milliliters per minute, the Pump 11 Elite Series guarantees high accuracy and smooth flow for precise experimental control.
- **Flexible Configuration Options:** Available in both Infusion Only and Infusion/Withdrawal Programmable Models, with options for single or dual syringe racks to best meet your experimental requirements.
- **Advanced Connectivity:** Equipped with a USB serial port for direct computer control, RS-485 (or an optional RJ-11) ports for linking multiple pumps, and Digital I/O for remote operation, these pumps are built to integrate seamlessly into your laboratory setup.

For researchers seeking a reliable, accurate, and user-friendly infusion solution, the Pump 11 Elite Series offers unmatched capabilities to enhance experimental outcomes.
