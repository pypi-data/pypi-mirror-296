## 👋 hello

Multimodal-Maestro gives you more control over large multimodal models to get the
outputs you want. With more effective prompting tactics, you can get multimodal models
to do tasks you didn't know (or think!) were possible. Curious how it works? Try our
HF [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Roboflow/SoM)!

🚧 The project is still under construction and the API is prone to change.

## 💻 install

⚠️ Our package has been renamed to `maestro`. Install package in a
[**3.11>=Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.
