## Sample usage

```python
from monotable import mono

headings = ["purchased\nparrot\nheart rate", "life\nstate"]

# > is needed to right align None cell since it auto-aligns to left.
# monotable uses empty string to format the second column.
formats = [">(none=rest).0f"]
cells = [
    [0, "demised"],
    [0.0, "passed on"],
    [None, "is no more"],
    [-1],
    [0, "ceased to be"],
]

print(
    mono(
        headings,
        formats,
        cells,
        title="Complaint\n(registered)",
        # top guideline is equals, heading is period, bottom is omitted.
        guideline_chars="=. ",
    )
)
```

sample output:

```expected-output
       Complaint
      (registered)
========================
 purchased
    parrot  life
heart rate  state
........................
         0  demised
         0  passed on
      rest  is no more
        -1
         0  ceased to be
```

## Dataclass to ASCII Table printer

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from enum import auto, Enum
from monotable import dataclass_print
from monotable import dataclass_format
from monotable import stow
```

### Print a dataclass instance

Print a dataclass as an ASCII table. The field names are left
justified in the left column. The values are right justified
in the right column.

```python
@dataclass
class CurrentConditions:
    temperature: float
    humidity: float
    heat_index: int

weather_data = CurrentConditions(80.0, 0.71, 83)
dataclass_print(weather_data)
```

```expected-output
CurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
humidity     0.71
heat_index     83
-----------------
```

### Title

The table title defaults to the class name. The string passed
to the "title" keyword is prepended to the class name.

```python
dataclass_print(weather_data, title="Airport")
```

```expected-output
Airport : CurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
humidity     0.71
heat_index     83
-----------------
```

### Format and print later

Call dataclass_format() to print or log later.

```python
text = dataclass_format(weather_data, title="Airport")
print(text)
```

```expected-output
Airport : CurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
humidity     0.71
heat_index     83
-----------------
```

### Add a format spec to a dataclass field

Specify formatting for a data class field as shown for
the field() call in place of the default value for the
humidity field below.

The function stow() assigns the dict {"spec": ".0%"} to
the field's metadata dict as the value for the key
"monotable".
The code internally applies this f-string: f"{value:{spec}}"
to format the value.

```python
@dataclass
class SpecCurrentConditions:
    temperature: float
    humidity: float = field(metadata=stow(spec=".0%"))
    heat_index: int

weather_data = SpecCurrentConditions(80.0, 0.71, 83)
dataclass_print(weather_data)
```

```expected-output
SpecCurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
humidity      71%
heat_index     83
-----------------
```

### Add a format function to a dataclass field

Specify a format function to do the formatting for a field.

Set the 'spec' key to a callable.
The function takes the field value as the parameter and returns a string.
The string is printed in the table. Note that just the enumeration
name "E" is printed instead of "Direction.E".

```python
class Direction(Enum):
    N = auto()
    E = auto()
    S = auto()
    W = auto()


@dataclass
class Wind:
    speed: int
    direction: Direction = field(metadata=stow(spec=lambda x: x.name))

wind_data = Wind(speed=11,direction=Direction.E)
dataclass_print(wind_data)
```

```expected-output
     Wind
-------------
speed      11
direction   E
-------------
```

### Add text to embellish a field name

Set the 'help' key to add text immediately after the field name.
This is printed in the table left column:
- dataclass field name
- 2 spaces
- 'help' key value.

```python
@dataclass
class MoreConditions:
    visibility: float = field(metadata=stow(help="(mi)",spec=".2f"))
    dewpoint: int = field(metadata=stow(help="(degF)"))

more_data = MoreConditions(visibility=10.00,dewpoint=71)
dataclass_print(more_data)
```

```expected-output
     MoreConditions
-----------------------
visibility  (mi)  10.00
dewpoint  (degF)     71
-----------------------
```

### When a dataclass field value is also dataclass

An additional ASCII table is printed for each nested dataclass.
The table is below and indented two spaces for each level of nesting.

```python
@dataclass
class MoreCurrentConditions:
    temperature: float
    humidity: float
    heat_index: int
    wind: Wind = field(metadata=stow(help="(2pm)"))

more_weather_data = MoreCurrentConditions(
    80.0, 0.71, 83, Wind(11, Direction.E)
    )
dataclass_print(more_weather_data)
```

The class name is printed in place of the value. The value of
the wind field is printed in a second table below the first
and indented two spaces.

```expected-output
MoreCurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
humidity     0.71
heat_index     83
wind  (2pm)  Wind
-----------------

  MoreCurrentConditions.wind  (2pm) : Wind
  -------------
  speed      11
  direction   E
  -------------
```

#### Omit printing a nested dataclass

To prevent levels of nested dataclasses from printing pass
keyword parameter max_depth. 1 means just print the top
level of dataclass. Note that only the classname of
the wind field value is printed.

```python
dataclass_print(more_weather_data, max_depth=1)
```

```expected-output
MoreCurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
humidity     0.71
heat_index     83
wind  (2pm)  Wind
-----------------
```


#### Print a bordered ASCII table

dataclass_print() passes extra keyword arguments to monotable.mono().
See monotable.mono()'s documentation. Some examples are below.

```python
dataclass_print(more_weather_data, max_depth=1, bordered=True)
```

```expected-output
MoreCurrentConditions
+-------------+------+
| temperature | 80.0 |
+-------------+------+
| humidity    | 0.71 |
+-------------+------+
| heat_index  |   83 |
+-------------+------+
| wind  (2pm) | Wind |
+-------------+------+
```

#### Print ASCII table with indent

```python
dataclass_print(more_weather_data, max_depth=1, indent="....")
```

```expected-output
....MoreCurrentConditions
....-----------------
....temperature  80.0
....humidity     0.71
....heat_index     83
....wind  (2pm)  Wind
....-----------------
```

#### Change the column alignment

```python
dataclass_print(more_weather_data, max_depth=1, formats=(">", "<"))
```

```expected-output
MoreCurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
   humidity  0.71
 heat_index  83
wind  (2pm)  Wind
-----------------
```

#### Print a nested dataclass that has a callable spec

For a dataclass field value, set the monotable field metadata
"spec" key to a function so that the value is printed in the top
level table rather than below as a separate table.

Note- This example is coded in Python REPL style so it can be tested
by the PYPI project phmutest using --replmode.

```python
>>> from dataclasses import dataclass, field
>>> from enum import auto, Enum
>>>
>>> from monotable import dataclass_print
>>> from monotable import stow
>>>
>>> class Direction(Enum):
...     N = auto()
...     E = auto()
...     S = auto()
...     W = auto()
>>>
>>> @dataclass
... class Wind:
...     speed: int
...     direction: Direction = field(metadata=stow(spec=lambda x: x.name))
>>>
>>> @dataclass
... class WindInline:
...     temperature: float
...     humidity: float
...     heat_index: int
...     wind: Wind = field(metadata=stow(spec=str))

>>> wind = Wind(11, Direction.E)
>>> wind_inline = WindInline(80.0, 0.71, 83, wind)
>>> dataclass_print(wind_inline)
                       WindInline
-------------------------------------------------------
temperature                                        80.0
humidity                                           0.71
heat_index                                           83
wind         Wind(speed=11, direction=<Direction.E: 2>)
-------------------------------------------------------
```

#### Left align the title

Note "<" at the start of title= specifies left alignment.
monotable detects alignment from the first character of the title.

```python
>>> dataclass_print(wind_inline, title="<Left Aligned Title")
Left Aligned Title : WindInline
-------------------------------------------------------
temperature                                        80.0
humidity                                           0.71
heat_index                                           83
wind         Wind(speed=11, direction=<Direction.E: 2>)
-------------------------------------------------------
```

#### Recipe to do dataclass_print as a mixin class.

```python
from typing import Any, Tuple

class DCPrint:
    """Mixin class for dataclass to add member function dcprint()."""

    # This should be the same signature as dataclass_print()
    # where dataclass_instance is replaced by self.
    def dcprint(
        self,
        *,
        # note- These 2 keyword args are monotable positional args.
        formats: Tuple[str, str] = ("", ">"),
        title: str = "",  # monotable title prefix
        **monotable_kwargs: Any,  # keyword args passed to monotable.mono().
    ) -> None:

        dataclass_print(
            self,
            formats=formats,
            title=title,
            **monotable_kwargs,
        )
```

Add DCPrint as a base class to the dataclass definition.

```python
@dataclass
class Temperatures(DCPrint):
    high: int
    low: int

temps = Temperatures(high=77, low=60)
temps.dcprint(title="High/Low Temperature")
```

```expected-output
High/Low Temperature : Temperatures
--------
high  77
low   60
--------
```

#### Copy of 2 earlier examples in REPL for testing on Python 3.7

```python
>>> @dataclass
... class MoreConditions:
...     visibility: float = field(metadata=stow(help="(mi)",spec=".2f"))
...     dewpoint: int = field(metadata=stow(help="(degF)"))
>>>
>>> more_data = MoreConditions(visibility=10.00,dewpoint=71)
>>> dataclass_print(more_data)
     MoreConditions
-----------------------
visibility  (mi)  10.00
dewpoint  (degF)     71
-----------------------
>>>
>>> @dataclass
... class MoreCurrentConditions:
...     temperature: float
...     humidity: float
...     heat_index: int
...     wind: Wind = field(metadata=stow(help="(2pm)"))
>>>
>>> more_weather_data = MoreCurrentConditions(
...     80.0, 0.71, 83, Wind(11, Direction.E)
...     )
>>> dataclass_print(more_weather_data)
MoreCurrentConditions
-----------------
temperature  80.0
humidity     0.71
heat_index     83
wind  (2pm)  Wind
-----------------
<BLANKLINE>
  MoreCurrentConditions.wind  (2pm) : Wind
  -------------
  speed      11
  direction   E
  -------------
```

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
