Testing and Benchmarking
------------------------

The *run.py* script provides an easy interface for building, testing,
benchmarking and more.

    $ python run.py <command> <command> ...

Below are the possible commands and what they do.

To explicitly test a custom algorithm, add ``'custom'`` to the
algorithms to use list.

.. automodule:: run
   :members:
