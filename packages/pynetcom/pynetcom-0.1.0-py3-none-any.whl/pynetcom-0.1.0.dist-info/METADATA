## Features

- Connect to network devices using REST API and CLI.
- Interact with management systems (e.g., Huawei NCE, Nokia NSP).
- Retrieve inventory data.
- Obtain alarm lists.
- Convenient token management for authorization.
- Automatic token refresh upon expiration.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pynetcom
```

## Development

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Install development dependencies

```

## Running Examples

To run examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd pynetcom
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

        ```

4. Add your configuration data to config.py:
    ```bash
    vi examples/config.py
    ```
    ```python
    API_NCE_USER =  "your_nce_api_user"
    API_NCE_PASS = "your_nce_password"
    API_NCE_HOST = "https://your_nce_hostip:26335"
    ```

5. Run an example script:

    ```bash
    python examples/huawei_nce.py
    ```


## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the library:

```python
from pynetcom import RestNCE

# Initialize connection to NCE
nce = RestNCE(API_NCE_HOST, API_NCE_USER, API_NCE_PASS)

# Get subnets from NCE
nce.send_request("/restconf/v2/data/huawei-nce-resource-inventory:subnets")
items = nce.get_data()
print(items)
```
