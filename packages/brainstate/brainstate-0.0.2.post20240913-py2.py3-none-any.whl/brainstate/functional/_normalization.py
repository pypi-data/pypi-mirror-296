  Scaled Weight Standardization,

  Parameters
  ----------
  w : jax.typing.ArrayLike
      The weight tensor.
  eps : float
      A small value to avoid division by zero.
  gain : Array
      The gain function, by default None.
  out_axis : int

  Returns
  -------
  jax.typing.ArrayLike
      The scaled weight tensor.
