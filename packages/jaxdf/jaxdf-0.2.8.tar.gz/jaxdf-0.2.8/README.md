## Overview

Jaxdf is a package based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) that provides a coding framework for creating differentiable numerical simulators with arbitrary discretizations.

The primary objective of Jaxdf is to aid in the construction of numerical models for physical systems, like wave propagation, or the numerical resolution of partial differential equations, in a manner that is easily tailored to the user's research requirements. These models are pure functions that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary differentiable programs written in [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). For instance, they can be employed as layers within neural networks, or utilized in constructing a physics loss function.


<br/>

## Example

The script below constructs the non-linear operator **(âˆ‡<sup>2</sup> + sin)**, applying a Fourier spectral discretization on a square 2D domain. It then utilizes this operator to define a loss function. The gradient of this loss function is calculated using JAX's Automatic Differentiation.


```python
from jaxdf import operators as jops
from jaxdf import FourierSeries, operator
from jaxdf.geometry import Domain
from jax import numpy as jnp
from jax import jit, grad


# Defining operator
@operator
def custom_op(u, *, params=None):
  grad_u = jops.gradient(u)
  diag_jacobian = jops.diag_jacobian(grad_u)
  laplacian = jops.sum_over_dims(diag_jacobian)
  sin_u = jops.compose(u)(jnp.sin)
  return laplacian + sin_u

# Defining discretizations
domain = Domain((128, 128), (1., 1.))
parameters = jnp.ones((128,128,1))
u = FourierSeries(parameters, domain)

# Define a differentiable loss function
@jit
def loss(u):
  v = custom_op(u)
  return jnp.mean(jnp.abs(v.on_grid)**2)

gradient = grad(loss)(u) # gradient is a FourierSeries
```

## Installation

Before proceeding with the installation of `jaxdf`, ensure that [JAX is already installed](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) on your system. If you intend to utilize `jaxdf` with NVidia GPU support, follow the instructions to install JAX accordingly.

To install `jaxdf` from PyPI, use the `pip` command:

```bash
pip install jaxdf
```

For development purposes, install `jaxdf` by either cloning the repository or downloading and extracting the compressed archive. Afterward, navigate to the root folder in a terminal, and execute the following command:
```bash
pip install --upgrade poetry
poetry install
```
This will install the dependencies and the package itself (in editable mode).
