Byron is a source code [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) designed to support assembly and high-level languages. It starts by generating a set of random programs, which are then iteratively improved by an [evolutionary algorithm](https://cad-polito-it.github.io/byron/evolution). Internally, it encodes candidate solutions as [typed](https://rcor.me/papers/typed-graph-theory.pdf), [directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Directed_graph) [multigraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph), and can effectively handle complex, realistic structures containing local and global variables, conditional and looping statements, and subroutines.

Programs can be evaluated using a user-defined Python function or an external tool, such as an interpreter or a simulator. Different types of parallelization are supported out of the box, from simple multithreading to the creation of temporary directories where multiple subprocesses are concurrently [spawned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(computing)).

**⚠️ Byron is currently in [alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) and under active development**

## Installation

As simple as

```
pip install --upgrade byron
```

A few dependencies can enhance Byron functionalities, but are not strictly required. You can get them all with

```
pip install --upgrade "byron[full]"
```

## Documentation

None yet, but some HOWTO's and examples [are available](https://github.com/cad-polito-it/byron/tree/alpha/examples) in the development repo.
