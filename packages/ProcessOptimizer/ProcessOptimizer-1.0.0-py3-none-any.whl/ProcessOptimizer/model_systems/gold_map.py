    Modified Branin-Hoo function. It has three approximate local minima.

    It returns a value between 0 and -3.1, interpreted as the negative value of
    amount of gold found at the given coordinates, in mg. The negative value is
    to make it play nicely together with ProcessOptimizer, which is a minimizer.
