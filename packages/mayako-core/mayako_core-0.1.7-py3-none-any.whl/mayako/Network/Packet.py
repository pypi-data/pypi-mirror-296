class Packet:
    """
    This module deserialises binary data received with an implemented protocol while also serialising data for network transfer. It provides functionality to split the header from the payload, performs checksum test and also verifies if a byte contains the flag for a mayakoProtocol packet.

    The structure of the binary packet is described in protocol_interface.md

    Do not access the members of the class directly, use the getter and setter functions to avoid unexpected behaviour.

    Attributes:
        _method : int (8bit)
            makes the first byte of each packet and the header. indicates the purpose of the packet in the mayako framework. can be one of 6 hexademical values which can be found in config.py
        _node_identity : int (32 bit)
            contains the name of the microcontroller or the client application which sent the packet. Node identity is a fixed-size 4 byte ASCII integer so that it can be integrated in the binary header. This lets everyone directly recognise the source of the packet and requires no further identification inside the payload. The node identity for each microcontroller and client application must be unique throughout the project and (probably) also in BLE/WiFi range. The node identity for the microcontroller is defined with the upload of a new build and can not changed for commands. 
        _sequence : int (16 bit)
            there is a difference between _sequence in the packet and sequence in the payload of sensor data. _sequence works across generic packets and tracks the order of the  packets. It is intended to work with ACK packets. the microcontroller app uses a 16 bit unsigned integer for _sequence, therefore we must be cautious and can only use _sequence until 2ยนโถ-1.
        _checksum : int (8 bit)
            we use CRC to calculate the checksum of the payload to ensure the integrity of the data. corrupted or incomplete data fails to test the checksum which should trigger a ACK packet with a retry request. the parameters for the CRC calculation can be found in protocol_interface.md.
        _payload_size : int (16 bit)
            to ensure that we can savely read the content of each packet, besides starting with the method flag, we integrated a payload size 2 byte field in the header on position 9 and 10. this contains the length of the payload and helps the protocols to read data until the end. therefore we do not have to rely on a newline character and can read/write binary data.
        _payload : bytes
            payload is of variable size and is encoded to utf-8 using JSON format. the size is sent in the header. more on the structure of payload can be read in protocol_interface.md.
            NYI: currently only text encoding is available. change encoding based on data (video data, audio data, etc.). we recommend an additional header field which indicates that encoding that has to be updated in the network protocol specification.
        _header_size : int (10 byte)
            the header size is an integral part of the packet and has a fix size of 10 bytes. this must be uniformly enforced across all implementation. failure to comply may result in unexpected behaviour, communication errors and data misinterpretations. Following th header, the payload has variable size only limited by the MTU of the implemented protocol. the header size is not integrated into the header because of its constant nature.
        _packet_size: int (variable)
            the sum of _header_size and _payload_size
