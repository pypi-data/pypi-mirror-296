# Welcome to radiofrance scraper CLI

A small CLI that downloads one or more podcasts from <https://www.radiofrance.fr/>.

I made this script because users are not allowed to download all podcasts on mobile. 

You can then transfer your favourite podcasts to your phone to listen to them offline! 

## How to

You can run [rf_scrapper.py](rf_scrapper.py) with 2 arguments:

1. must either be a link to the podcast you want to download or the path to a file were each line is a link. A new line is created each time you press the Enter key, so don't be fooled by the notepad when it displays the link you just pasted over two lines!
2. the output folder in which you want to put your downloads. By default, it is in the same folder as [rf_scrapper.py](rf_scrapper.py).

For example..

```batch
python rf_scrapper.py "put here a link in brackets"
```

or

```batch
python rf_scrapper.py "list.py" "output"
```

are both correct ways to launch the CLI !
