# unblock

unblock comes with utilities that can be used to convert synchronous functions to async for use in event loop.
For documentation, refer [here](https://unblock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Here is a quick example,

```python
import asyncio
from unblock import asyncify
   
@asyncify
def my_sync_func():
   #do something

if __name__ == "__main__":
   asyncio.run(my_sync_func())
```
