# Help

```bash
$ snapsheets -h
usage: snapsheets [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--url URL] [--debug] [--version]

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG  set config directory (default: ./config/)
  --url URL        copy and paste an URL of the Google spreadsheet
  --debug          show more messages
  --version        show program's version number and exit
```

- Use ``--url`` option to download single spreadsheet.
- Use ``--config`` option to download multiple spreadsheets.
  - create a directory for config files.
  - create a config file in TOML format.

# Examples

## with ``--url`` option

```bash
$ snapsheets --url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NbSH0rSCLkElG4UcNVuIhmg5EfjAk3t8TxiBERf6kBM/edit#gid=0"

2022-06-09T08:09:31 | SUCCESS  | ğŸš€ Renamed to snapd/20220609T080931_snapsheet.xlsx
```

- Downloaded file is temporarily named as ``snapsheet.xlsx``, then renamed with current-time based prefix.

## with ``--config`` option

```bash
$ snapsheets --config="config/"

```

- Make ``./config/`` directory and place your TOML files.
  - If ``./config/`` does not exist, it will search from ``. (current directory)``.
- Downloaded files are saved to ``./snapd/`` directory
  - If ``./snapd/`` does not exit, it will be saved in ``. (current directory)``.

## with module ``import``

```python
>>> from snapsheets import Sheet
>>> url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NbSH0rSCLkElG4UcNVuIhmg5EfjAk3t8TxiBERf6kBM/edit#gid=0"
>>> sheet = Sheet(url=url, desc="Get Sample Sheet")
