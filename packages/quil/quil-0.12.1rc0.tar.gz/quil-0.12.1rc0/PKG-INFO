# Quil

⚠️ In Development

The `quil` package provides tools for constructing, manipulating, parsing, and printing [Quil](https://github.com/quil-lang/quil) programs. Internally, it is powered by [quil-rs](https://github.com/rigetti/quil-rs).

This package is still in early development and breaking changes should be expected between minor versions.

# Documentation

Documentation for the current release of `quil` is published [here](https://rigetti.github.io/quil-rs/quil.html). Every version of `quil` ships [with type stubs](https://github.com/rigetti/quil-rs/tree/main/quil-py/quil) that provide type hints and documentation to Python tooling and editors that support the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) or similar.
