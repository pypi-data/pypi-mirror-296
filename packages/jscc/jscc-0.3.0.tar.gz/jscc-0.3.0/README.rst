This Python package provides methods for testing standards that use JSON Schema and CSV codelists with `custom JSON Schema properties <https://os4d.opendataservices.coop/development/schema/#extended-json-schema>`__, like:

* Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), plus its extensions and profiles
* Open Contracting for Infrastructure Data Standard (OC4IDS)
* Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS)
* Social Investment Data Lab Specification (SEDL)

The following packages also support multiple standards:

* `OCDS Babel <https://ocds-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, which provides Babel extractors and translation methods
* `OCDS Kit <https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, which provides `commands <https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/schema.html>`__ for transforming JSON Schema, and methods for `creating a mapping sheet <https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/mapping_sheet.html>`__ and for `yielding a schema's fields <https://ocdskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/schema.html>`__.
