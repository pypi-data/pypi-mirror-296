        Parameters

            The path to load the synthesis object from

            map_location argument to pass to ``torch.load``. If you save
            stuff that was being run on a GPU and are loading onto a
            CPU, you'll need this to make sure everything lines up
            properly. This should be structured like the str you would
            pass to ``torch.device``
        check_attributes :
            List of strings we ensure are identical in the current
            ``Synthesis`` object and the loaded one. Checking the model is
            generally not recommended, since it can be hard to do (checking
            callable objects is hard in Python) -- instead, checking the
            ``base_representation`` should ensure the model hasn't functinoally
            changed.
        check_loss_functions :
            Names of attributes that are loss functions and so must be checked
            specially -- loss functions are callables, and it's very difficult
            to check python callables for equality so, to get around that, we
            instead call the two versions on the same pair of tensors,
            and compare the outputs.

        pickle_load_args :
            any additional kwargs will be added to ``pickle_module.load`` via
            ``torch.load``, see that function's docstring for details.
