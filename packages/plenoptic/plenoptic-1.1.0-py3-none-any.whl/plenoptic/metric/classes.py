class NLP(torch.nn.Module):
    r"""simple class for implementing normalized laplacian pyramid

    This class just calls
    ``plenoptic.metric.normalized_laplacian_pyramid`` on the image and
    returns a 3d tensor with the flattened activations.

    NOTE: synthesis using this class will not be the exact same as
    synthesis using the ``plenoptic.metric.nlpd`` function (by default),
    because the ``nlpd`` function uses the root-mean square of the L2 distance (i.e.,
    ``torch.sqrt(torch.mean(x-y)**2))`` as the distance metric between representations.
