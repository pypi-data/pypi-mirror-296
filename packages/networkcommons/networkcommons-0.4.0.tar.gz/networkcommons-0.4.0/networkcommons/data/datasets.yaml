      description: Pancancer Analysis of Chemical Entity Activity RNA-Seq data
      publication_link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100492
      detailed_description: >-
        PANACEA contains dose-response and perturbational profiles for 32
        kinase inhibitors in 11 cancer cell lines, in addition to a DMSO control.
        Originally, this resource served as the basis for a DREAM Challenge
        assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of computational algorithms for
        de novo drug polypharmacology predictions.
