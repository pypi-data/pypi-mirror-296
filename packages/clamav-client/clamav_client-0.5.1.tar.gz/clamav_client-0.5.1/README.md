`clamav-client` is a portable Python module to use the ClamAV anti-virus engine
on Windows, Linux, MacOSX and other platforms. It requires a running instance
of the `clamd` daemon.

This is a fork of [clamd] ([5c5e33b2]) created by Thomas Grainger. It introduces
type hints and tests exclusively against supported Python versions.
