protmaster: Tools For working with proteomics
=====================================================================================================

protmaster is a Python package designed to process high-resolution mass spectrometry data that is coupled with liquid chromatography (LC). Its primary objective is to provide scientists with a user-friendly tool that can be used to read, process, and visualize proteomics data acquired using LC/GC-HRMS .

By utilizing protmaster, users can more easily analyze complex data sets, resulting in a more efficient and streamlined research process. Whether working with LC coupled HRMS data, protmaster is a reliable and effective solution that can help researchers to achieve their scientific goals.
