                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Filepass Package #

Filepass package is a comprehensive Python package designed to facilitate the transfer of the files across different locations and protocols with ease.
It supports SFTP, SMB, and LOCAL file systems, and offers functionalities like file renaming (in single file mode) and selective file transfer based on assigned filter.
It also offeres advanced file management features such as conditional deletion of files.
With support for both custom handler and local logging, 'Filepass' ensures that you can keep a detailed log of your file trasnfers, making troubleshooting and monitoring a breeze.


## Features ##

- **Multiple Protocols Support**:
Seamlessly transfer files using SFTP, SMB, and LOCAL file systems.

- **Flexible File Selection**:
Use 'from_filter' parameter to specify exactly which files to transfer, supporting both specific filenames and wildcards for multiple files.

- **File Renaming (in single file transfer mode)**
Easily rename files during single file transfer mode.

- **Connection Objects**:
Utilize the pre-defined connnection objects for efficient and secure connections to server.

- **Conditional File Deletion**:
Automatically delete older files at the destination before transfer using 'to_delete', or remove source files after a successful transfer using 'from_delete'.

- **Advanced Logging**:
Enable custom logging handler by defining the server name, port number and adding the handler to the logger defined. Otherwise, default to local logging to stdout for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Installation ##

pip install filepass

## Quick Start ##
1. Import Filepass package:
    e.g.:
    ```from filepass import file_pass, ConnectionDetails, FilepassMethod```

2. Set up connection - create a connection object (ConnectionDetails) based on your protocol of choice. FilepassMethod offers three protocols: SFTP, SMB, and LOCAL
    e.g.:

        ```python
        sourceServer = ConnectionDetails(
        method=FilepassMethod.SMB,
        user="user",
        password="password",
        server="servername",
        port="portnumber",
        dir="directory/folder",
        share="SMB share",
        )
        destinationServer = ConnectionDetails(
            method=FilepassMethod.SFTP,
            user="user",
            password="password",
            server="servername",
            port="portnumber",
            dir="directory/folder",
        )
        ```


3. Configure Logging:
    (Optional)
    If you want to enable custom handler logging, such as Graylog logging. Set the server details as follows:
    Example: Graylog
        * Import the required library for custom logging - import graypy
        * Add the handler to your defined logger:

            ```python
            handler = graypy. graypy.GELFTCPHandler(
                ("servername"), int("portnumber")
            )
            ```

    If you want to simply use local logging:
        * Import python logging package.
        * Define the logger and handler.
            * E.g., handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
        * Add the handler to your defined logger.

4. Define the required parameters for file transfer:
    * from_filter = "filename/wildcard"
        * e.g.
            ```python
            from_filter = "*.txt"  #transfers all files in the directory, with .txt extension.
            from_filter = "transfer_file.csv"  #transfers the selected file.```
    * to_delete = "yes or no".
    * from_delete = "yes or no".
    * logger = set custom handler or local handler.

5. Rename file in single file transfer mode:
    Rename a file during transfer by specifying the new_filename parameter such as:
    * e.g.,
    ```python
    new_filename = "newfilename"
    ```

    Defaults to 'None', if parameter is not defined.

6. Transfer Files:
    Use the file_pass method to move files to move files from one location to another.
    * e.g.,
        ```python
        file_pass(
            logger,
            from_conn,
            to_conn,
            from_filter,
            to_delete,
            from_delete,
            new_filename,
        )
        ```
