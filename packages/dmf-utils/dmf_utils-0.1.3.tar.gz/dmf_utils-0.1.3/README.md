DMF Utils is a Python package that provides a collection of utility functionalities to simplify common tasks in experiment and data analysis workflows. The package contains modules used by our group to facilitate tasks in neuroscience research.

## Quick Start

This package is designed in a modular way, with some functionalities included in this repository and others in separate packages that can be called from here. This allows for installing only the components needed for a specific project, aiming to maintain the broadest compatibility with different Python versions.

You can install the core package with pip or other package managers by running:

```bash
pip install dmf-utils
```

See the [documentation](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/) for more installation options and help, including how to use it in environments without internet access.
