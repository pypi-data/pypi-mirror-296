DMF Utils is a Python package that provides a collection of utility functionalities to simplify common tasks in experiment and data analysis workflows. The package contains modules used by our group to facilitate tasks in neuroscience research.

## Quick Start

This package is designed in a modular way, with some functionalities included in this repository and others in separate packages that can be called from here. This allows for installing only the components needed for a specific project, aiming to maintain the broadest compatibility with different Python versions.

You can install the core package with pip or other package managers by running:

```bash
pip install dmf-utils
```

See the [documentation](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/) for more installation options and help, including how to use it in environments without internet access.

## Modules

* [Alerts](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/alerts.html): Get notified when a function finishes running and send messages or files to Slack and Telegram.
* [Env](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/env.html): Manage environment variables.
* [IO (Input/Output)](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/io.html): Load and save data from different formats, and manage compressed files.
* [Models](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/models.html): Utilities for PyTorch models.
* [Video](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/video.html): Utilities to work with video files.


See the [modules documentation](https://dmf-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/index.html) for more information.
