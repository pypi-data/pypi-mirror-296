Features
--------

The core function of this project is implemented as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def seqpad(seq):
        while len(seq) % 3 != 0:
            seq += "N"
        return seq

The project also provides a CLI that can also be accessed from within python. For more information read the help message that can be accessed through one of the two following ways.

.. code-block:: bash
