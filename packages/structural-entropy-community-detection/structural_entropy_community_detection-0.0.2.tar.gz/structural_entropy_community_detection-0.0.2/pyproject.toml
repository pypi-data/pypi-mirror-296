description = "This repository contains the code for structural entropy community detection. The philosophy behind this method is to use the structural entropy of a network to detect communities. The structural entropy is a measure of the uncertainty of the network structure. The idea is that the higher the uncertainty, the more likely it is that the network is divided into communities."
