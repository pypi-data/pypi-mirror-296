    """
    A class representing a Turing machine, which processes a tape based on its
    current state and head position.

    Attributes:
        - head (Head): The head of the Turing machine, responsible for reading
          and writing on the tape.
        - state (State): The current state of the Turing machine, determining
          its behavior based on the tape's symbols.

        """
        Run the Turing machine on the given tape. The machine reads symbols
        from the tape, updates the tape based on the current stat, and moves
        the head accordingly. It stops when there are no more transitions
        defined for the current state and symbol.

            - tape (Tape): The tape on which the Turing machine operates.
