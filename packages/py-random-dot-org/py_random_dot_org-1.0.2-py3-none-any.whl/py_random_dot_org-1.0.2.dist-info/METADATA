Random.org API Wrapper
======================

This Python module provides a wrapper for the `Random.org API`_ to generate various types of random data such as integers,
sequences, decimal fractions, Gaussian numbers, strings, UUIDs, and random blobs.

Features
--------

- Generate random integers, integer sequences, decimal fractions, and Gaussian-distributed numbers.
- Generate random strings, UUIDs, and blobs.
- Retrieve API usage statistics, including remaining bits and requests.

Installation
------------



Usage
-----

1. Import the ``BasicApi`` class and initialize it with your Random.org API key:
   ::

       from basic_api import BasicApi

       api = BasicApi(api_key="your_api_key")

2. Call the available methods to generate random data. For example, to generate random integers:
   ::

       random_integers = api.generate_integers(num=5, minimum=1, maximum=100)
       print(random_integers)

3. You can also check your API usage:
   ::

       usage_stats = api.get_usage()
       print(usage_stats)

Running Tests
-------------

The project includes tests written using ``pytest``. To run the tests:

1. Install ``pytest``:
   ::

       pip install pytest

2. Run the tests:
   ::

       pytest
