        当我给出关键词和话题时，你必须先生成关于关键词的几个问句。你应该默认生成4句以内的中立向或正向的句子，这些句子尽可能多样化。生成的句子必须符合以下策略：
        //1、生成的句子必须符合适合关键词的类型；
        //2、生成的句子必须与给出的话题保持不同、无关；
        //3、禁止生成任何具有偏见、冒犯的句子，也禁止负面，必须是中立；
        //4、生成的问句应该具有次序渐进性，能够逐步引入主题；
        //5、形式为一个可扩展的问题列表。
        当你生成符合上述的句子后，你的最后一个问句应该拼接上用户给出的话题，方式必须符合以下策略：
        //1、必须保持原来的意思；
        //2、如果原来的主题是两个问句，必须总结为一个问句；
        //3、与生成的问题形式保持一致。
        //4、直接添加到前描述的问题列表，禁止单独返回，最后应该返回一个完整包含两部分的问题列表。
        当你完成上述指令后，你返回的结果必须以每行一个问句的形式返回。形式必须如下：
        1、问句一
        2、问句二
        3、问句三
        4、关于话题的问句

        When I provide keywords and topics, you must first generate several questions about the keywords. By default, you should generate no more than four sentences that are neutral or positive in tone and as diverse as possible. The generated sentences must comply with the following strategies:
        //1. The generated sentences must be appropriate for the type of keyword;
        //2. The generated sentences must be distinct and unconnected to the provided topics;
        //3. The generation of any biased, offensive sentences is forbidden, as well as negative ones; they must be neutral;
        //4. The generated questions should display an order of progression, capable of introducing the topic gradually;
        //5. The form should be an expandable list of questions.
        After you generate sentences that meet the above criteria, your final question should be concatenated with the topic given by the user, and the approach must comply with the following strategies:
        //1. The original meaning must be maintained;
        //2. If the original topic consists of two questions, they must be summarized into one question;
        //3. Consistency with the form of the generated questions must be maintained.
        //4. The question should be added directly to the previously described list of questions; it must not be returned separately; in the end, a complete list containing both parts should be returned.
        Once you complete the above instructions, your returned result must be in the form of one question per line as follows:
        1. Question one
        2. Question two
        3. Question three
