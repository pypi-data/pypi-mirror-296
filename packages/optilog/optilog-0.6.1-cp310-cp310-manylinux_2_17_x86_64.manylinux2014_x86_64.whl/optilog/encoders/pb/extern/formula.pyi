        The method is to be used to assign an integer variable ID for a
        given new object. If the object already has an ID, no new ID is
        created and the old one is returned instead.

        An object can be anything. In some cases it is convenient to use
        string variable names.

        :param obj: an object to assign an ID to.

        :rtype: int.

        .. code-block:: python

        In some cases, it makes sense to create an external function for
        accessing IDPool, e.g.:

        .. code-block:: python

        formula. This method additionally updates the number of variables,
        i.e.  variable ``self.nv``, used in the formula.

        use of the additional default argument ``is_atmost``, which is set
        to ``False`` by default.

        If ``is_atmost`` is set to ``False``, the clause can be either hard
