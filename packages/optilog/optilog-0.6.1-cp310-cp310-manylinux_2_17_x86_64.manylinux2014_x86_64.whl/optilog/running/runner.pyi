        Note that all globs in this class are relative to the current working directory.

        :param tasks: Glob string that matches the instances to execute. A list of instances may also be provided.
        :param submit_file: Script used to submit a job to the cluster. The Execution Scenario is agnostic to the system where jobs will be executed. See the :ref:`submit-command-examples` section for some examples of submission commands for different systems

                        If it is a string, it must represent the glob of a set of solvers.

                        If it is a dictionary, each key must be the name of the solver and each value must be a valid `RunningSolverType`.

        :param logs: Path used to save the logs of the execution (both stdout and stderr). By default, they are saved in a `logs` folder in the scenario directory.
        :param slots: Number of slots to reserve on the cluster. Usually corresponds with the number of execution threads.
        :param seeds: List of seeds for the execution.
        :param working_dir: Working directory of execution environment. Defaults to the current working directory.
        :param timestamp: Whether to record the timestamp of every line or not. Possible values are: `False`, for no timestamp; `True` for automatic timestamp; `optilog` for timestamp in OptiLog format or `runsolver` for timestamp in runsolver format. If `True`, it will use RunSolver if it is the current enfocer, and OptiLog otherwise. Note that this will automatically add timestamp as a flag to runsolver.
        :param unbuffer: Whether to force the solver through the `unbuffer` command. `unbuffer` must be in the PATH.
