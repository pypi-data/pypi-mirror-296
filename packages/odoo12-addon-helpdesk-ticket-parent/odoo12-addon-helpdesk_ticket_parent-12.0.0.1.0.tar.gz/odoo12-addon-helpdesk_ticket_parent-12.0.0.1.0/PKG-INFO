Create global helpdesk tickets massively, from multiple preselected partners or contracts

Configuration
=============

No configuration needed for this module.

Usage
=====

This module reuses the Mass creation module, so here is what it can inherently do:

To create global tickets (with same content) for multiple partners / contracts:

- Contacts (tree view) / Contracts (tree view) + selection > Actions > Create tickets massively
- Fill ticket information > Create.


Apart from that:

- This module links the created tickets to a common created global parent.
- You can add child tickets to an already created global parent ticket through the `header button` in the global ticket view.
- The stages of the child tickets are tracked and propagated from the global parent to the childs upon changed.
    - Also when some child ticket stage is further in sequence than the parent for any reason (e.g. closed) it will keep it this way until the parent reaches the same sequence.

And one of the main features that this hierarchical structure allows is to send massive emails to all the partners,
you can do it by going into the global parent ticket view and you'll find a `header button`. You'll be prompted
a convenient wizard to craft your mail in each of the languages of the partners.

After sending it you will be able to see the mails queued in the `queue` app. And after sent they 
each will be appended to their respective child ticket.



Known issues / Roadmap
