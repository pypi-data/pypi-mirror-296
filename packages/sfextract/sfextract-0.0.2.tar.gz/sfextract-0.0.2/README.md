# sfextract

This library tries to extract all internal files associated with Setup Factory executables. This extractor is based on [SFUnpacker](https://github.com/Puyodead1/SFUnpacker) but is meant to be fully executable on Linux.

## Use

By installing this library, you should be able to simply execute `sfextract` from your commandline, if you wish to use it as a fully functional tool instead of an imported library.

## Limitations

This library has the same limitations as the one it was based on. It currently only support Setup Factory 7, 8 and 9. At this moment, as opposed to SFUnpacker, this version does not support LZMA2.
