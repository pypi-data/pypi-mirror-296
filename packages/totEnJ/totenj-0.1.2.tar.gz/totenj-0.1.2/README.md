# Heisenberg exchange and DMI from DFT-calculated supercell total energies

<i>**Tools for preparing magnetic supercells and extracting (anisotropic) exchange interaction and DMI from their total energies (calculated for instance by DFT).**</i>

```
pip install totEnJ

## Usage
See the Jupyter notebooks in the `./examples` folder.

## Heisenberg exchange

Calculate **Heisenberg exchange** (in-plane and out-of-plane, uniaxial anisotropy) from total energy of magnetic supercells.

## DMI

Calculate **Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction coefficients** to arbitrary neighbor from DFT total energy for a linear chain (for now) - many systems will be equivalent however.

- nice-to-have functions:
  - automatically decide what spin spirals to use for a given problem and construct the supercells (and MAGMOM tag)
  - choose along which unit cell vector
