        x, y: the coordinate of the top left of the frame, in its master.
        width, height: the dimension of the frame.
        background: A BackgroundsLike object. If it is a Color, create a surface of this color. RGBA colors are possible.
        if it is a str, and this str is in the pygame.colors.THECOLORS dict, find the color with the dict.
        if it is Surface, reshape the surface.
        if it is an ImageFile, get the surface from it.
        If it is a list of one of them, create a list of surfaces. The background is then changed every gif_duration.
        focus_background: Another BackgroundsLike object. Same as 'background' but used when the frame is focused.
        layer: the layer of the frame on its master. Objects having the same master are blitted on it by increasing layer.
        image_duration (ms): If a list is provided as background, the background of the frame is changes every image_duration.
        if image_duration is a list, it must have the same length as background.
        in this case, the i-th image of the background will be displayed image_duration[i] ms.
        focus_image_duration: same as image_duration but when the frame is focused.
        image_introduction: int, if you provided a list for the backgrounds, the background will not cycle back to 0
        but to this index. 
        focus_image_introduction: same as image_introduction but when the frame is focused.
        hover_surface: Surface. If a surface is provided, it to be displayed at the mouse location when the
        frame is hovered by the mouse.
        hover_cursor: Cursor. If a cursor is provided, it is the cursor of the mouse when the mouse is over the frame.
