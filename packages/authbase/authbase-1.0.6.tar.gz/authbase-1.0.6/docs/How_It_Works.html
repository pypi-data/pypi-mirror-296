      <h1>AuthBase</h1>
      <p>Email-only authentication for FastAPI webapps.</p>
    </header>

    
    
    <style>h2 { text-align: center; }</style>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>AuthBase is good if you want to ship something quickly to test out a concept
and don't want to spend any time on an authentication system.</p>
<p>It is designed to provide boilerplate FastAPI code for a webapp.</p>
<p>It doesn't use passwords for authentication, instead it relies on users
clicking a link that was sent to their email address. The logic behind this is
that usually there is a reset password option that sends an email anyway, so in
theory it is a system that has the same or a similar level of security.</p>
<p>AuthBase also provides some basic utility functions for emailing the users, and
getting user information from the database.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Email confirmation upon user sign up to verify the user's email address.</li>
<li>Sign in link emailed to users upon sign in.</li>
<li>Plans for security fingerprint that displays browser, ip address, and where
possible, approximate location, of the person trying to log in.</li>
<li>Plans for an unsubscribe link at the bottom of all emails sent through the
gateway.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<pre><code>pip install authbase
</code></pre>
<p>Then in your FastAPI webapp:</p>
<pre><code>from fastapi import FastAPI
from authbase import install_auth_routes

app = FastAPI()
install_auth_routes(app)

# ... the rest of your code goes here ...
</code></pre>
<p>Then edit config.py in the root directory of your project to contain:</p>
<pre><code># Name of your webapp.
WEBAPP_NAME='My Example App'

# Email settings.
SMTP_HOST='smtp.example.org'
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME='username'
SMTP_PASSWORDD='password'
SENDER_ADDRESS='My Example App &lt;no-reply@example.org&gt;'

# Redirct URL where users are sent after they successfully confirm their email
# address or sign up.
REDIRECT_URL='https://example.org/signed-in'
</code></pre>
<h2>API</h2>
<h3>POST /auth</h3>
<p>Signs up a new user or initiates the sign in process.</p>
<p>This endpoint takes a single parameter, <strong>email_address</strong>, which should be the
email address of the user signing up or signing in.</p>
<p>The response is HTML with a message instructing the user to check their email
for a confirmation link or a link to sign in.</p>
<p>This response sets a session_id cookie.</p>
<p>Here's an example JS snippet that you can attach to a form submit event:</p>
<pre><code>const form = document.getElementById("my-sign-in-form")
form.addEventListener("submit", event =&gt; {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
    fetch("https://api.example.org/auth", {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
        credentials: "include",
    }).then(... handle response ...);
});
</code></pre>
<h3>POST /sign_out</h3>
<p>This endpoint takes no parameters and signs out the user associated with the
session_id cookie.</p>
<p>Here's an example JS snippet that makes this request:</p>
<pre><code>await fetch('https://api.example.org/sign_out', {
    method: 'POST',
    credentials: 'include',
}); 
</code></pre>
<h3>GET /me</h3>
<p>Gets information about the currently signed in user.</p>
<p>The request should send the session_id cookie.</p>
<p>The response is A JSON object with two fields, <strong>id</strong>, and <strong>email_address</strong>.</p>
<p>This response returns error 401 UNAUTHENTICATED if the user has not signed in.</p>
<p>Here's an example JS snippet that makes this request:</p>
<pre><code>fetch('https://api.example.org/me', {
    method: 'GET',
    credentials: 'include',
}).then(... handle response ...);
</code></pre>
<h3>GET /sign_in/{session_secret}</h3>
<p>This endpoint is for internal use only.</p>
<h3>get_user(user_id)</h3>
<p>This function gets a specific user.</p>
<p>Returns a dictionary containing <strong>id</strong> and <strong>email_address</strong>.</p>
<h3>get_users()</h3>
<p>This function gets all users.</p>
<p>Returns a list of dictionaries containing <strong>id</strong> and <strong>email_address</strong>.</p>
