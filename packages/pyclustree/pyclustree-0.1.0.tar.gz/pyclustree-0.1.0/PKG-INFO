Visualize cluster assignments at different resolutions. Possbile applications include finding the optimal resolution for
single-cell RNA-sequencing clusterings.

`pyclustree` is inspired by the R package `clustree`, however, while we aim to provide the same functionality, the API
will differ between the implementations.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

-   [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install pyclustree:

1. Install the latest release of `pyclustree` from [PyPI][link-pypi]:

```bash
pip install pyclustree
```

2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/complextissue/pyclustree.git@dev
```

## Contact

If you found a bug, please use the [issue tracker][issue-tracker].
