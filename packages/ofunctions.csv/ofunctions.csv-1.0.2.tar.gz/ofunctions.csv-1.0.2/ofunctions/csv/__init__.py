    Reads CSV file and provides a generator for every line and skips commented out lines

    ATTENTION, this gave me headaches:
    Python < 3.6 returns unordered dicts, so it looks like results are random, but only the dict order is
    Python == 3.7 returns OrderedDict instead of dict
    Python >= 3.8 returns dict with ordered results
