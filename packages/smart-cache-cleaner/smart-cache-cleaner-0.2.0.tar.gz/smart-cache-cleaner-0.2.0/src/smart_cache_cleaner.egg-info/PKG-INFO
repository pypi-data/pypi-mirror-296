# Smart Cache Cleaner

Smart Cache Cleaner is a cross-platform Python utility for efficiently managing and cleaning cache and temporary files.

## Features

- Smart scanning of common cache and temp directories
- Customizable file filtering by size and age
- Secure deletion with file integrity checks
- Memory-efficient batch processing
- Detailed logging and verbose output options
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Interactive command-line interface with file-by-file decision making
- Summary of files by extension before deletion

## Installation

You can install Smart Cache Cleaner directly from PyPI:


`pip install smart-cache-cleaner`



## Usage

After installation, you can run Smart Cache Cleaner from anywhere in your terminal:


`smart-cache-cleaner [options]`



### Available options:

- `-d` or `--directory`: Specify a custom directory to scan
- `-s` or `--min-size`: Minimum file size to consider (in bytes)
- `-a` or `--max-age`: Maximum file age to consider (in days, 0 for no limit)
- `-y` or `--yes`: Skip confirmation for deletion
- `-v` or `--verbose`: Increase output verbosity

### Interactive Prompts

During the scanning process, you will be prompted for each file:

- `y`: Yes, delete this file
- `n`: No, skip this file
- `q`: Quit the scanning process

You can use the `-y` option to skip these prompts and delete all matched files automatically.

### Example:


`smart-cache-cleaner -d /path/to/custom/directory -s 1000000 -a 30`


This command would scan the specified directory, only considering files larger than 1 MB and not older than 30 days.

## Safety Features

Smart Cache Cleaner includes several safety features to protect your system and data:

- File hash verification before deletion to ensure file integrity
- Symlink protection to prevent accidental deletion of linked files
- Maximum directory depth limit to prevent infinite recursion
- Memory usage monitoring to prevent excessive memory consumption
- Batch processing to handle large directories efficiently
