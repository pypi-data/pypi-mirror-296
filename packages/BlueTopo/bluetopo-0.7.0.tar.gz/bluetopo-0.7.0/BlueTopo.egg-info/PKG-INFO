        Statement of Purpose
        
        The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
        exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
        subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
        authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
        
        Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
        purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
        works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
        claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
        and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
        purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
        contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
        further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
        reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
        efforts of others.
        
        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
        of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
        Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
        and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
        and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
        effect of CC0 on those rights.
        
        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
        Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
        to, the following:
        
          i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
          and translate a Work;
        
          ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
        
          iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
          depicted in a Work;
        
          iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
          subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
        
          v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
          a Work;
        
          vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
          European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
          protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
          including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
        
          vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
          based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
        
        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
        applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
        unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
        and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
        known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
        action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
        duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
        extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
        copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
        commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
        the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
        detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
        shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
        any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
        by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        
        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
        judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
        shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
        is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
        non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
        unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
        the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
        provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
        in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
        promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
        of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
        License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
        applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
        invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
        affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
        and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        
        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
        
          a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
          surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
        
          b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
          of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
          including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
          for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
          other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
          discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
        
          c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
          that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
          any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
          disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
          or other rights required for any use of the Work.
        
          d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
          party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
          CC0 or use of the Work.

## Overview

This package simplifies getting BlueTopo data in your area of interest.

## Background

[BlueTopo](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/bluetopo.html) is a compilation of the best available public bathymetric data of U.S. waters.

Created by [NOAA Office of Coast Survey's](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/) National Bathymetric Source project, [BlueTopo data](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/bluetopo_specs.html) intends to provide depth information nationwide with the vertical uncertainty tied to that depth estimate as well as information on the survey source that it originated from.

This data is presented in a multiband high resolution GeoTIFF with an associated raster attribute table.

For answers to frequently asked questions, visit the [FAQ](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/bluetopo_faq.html).

## Requirements

This codebase is written for Python 3 and relies on the following python
packages:

- gdal / ogr
- numpy
- boto3
- tqdm

## Installation

Install conda (If you have not already): [conda installation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

In the command line, create an environment with the required packages:

```
conda create -n bluetopo_env -c conda-forge 'gdal>=3.4'
```

```
conda activate bluetopo_env
```

```
pip install bluetopo
```

## Quickstart

To download the desired files, first create a geometry file (such as a geopackage) with a polygon depicting the area of interest. Then run the following commands inside of a Python shell:

```python
from nbs.bluetopo import fetch_tiles
```

```python
fetch_tiles(r'C:\download_path', 'area_of_interest.gpkg')
```

To build a GDAL VRT of the downloaded tiles:

```python
from nbs.bluetopo import build_vrt
```

```python
build_vrt(r'C:\download_path')
```

## CLI

You can also use the command line. Confirm the environment we created during installation is activated.

To fetch the latest BlueTopo data, use `fetch_tiles` passing a directory path and a geometry file path with a polygon depicting your area of interest:

```
fetch_tiles -d [DIRECTORY PATH] -g [GEOMETRY FILE PATH]
```

Pass the same directory path to `build_vrt` to create a VRT from the fetched data:

```
build_vrt -d [DIRECTORY PATH]
```

Use `-h` for help and to see additional arguments.

For most usecases, reusing the commands above to stay up to date in your area of interest is adequate.

## Notes

In addition to BlueTopo, modeling data is available. You can work with modeling data using the `source` argument in the CLI commands or the `data_source` argument if you're calling the function directly.

The primary difference between BlueTopo and modeling data is the vertical datum. Modeling data is on a low water datum.
