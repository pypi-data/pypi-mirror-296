To install the official [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/humanloop/), run the following command:  ```bash pip install humanloop ```  To install the official [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanloop), run the following command:  ```bash npm i humanloop ```  ---  Guides and further details about key concepts can be found in [our docs](https://docs.humanloop.com/).
