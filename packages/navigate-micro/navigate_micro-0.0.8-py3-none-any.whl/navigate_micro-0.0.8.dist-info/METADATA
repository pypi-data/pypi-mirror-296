**navigate** is an open source Python package for control of light-sheet microscopes.
It allows for easily reconfigurable hardware setups and automated acquisition rotuines.

### Quick install

Download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links).

```
conda create -n navigate python=3.9.7
conda activate navigate
pip install git+https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate.git
```

To test, run `conda activate navigate` and launch in synthetic hardware mode with `navigate
-sh`. Developers will have to install additional dependencies with
`pip install -e '.[dev]'`.
