    Note
    ----
        The SCA814 has a single character input buffer that can be overflowed if the
        proper steps are not taken. To avoid overflowing the input buffer the user
        should send a single character at a time and wait for that same character to
        be echoed back by the controller. While not necessary, it is advisable to
        verify that the character received from the controller is the same character
        sent. Once the character is received the next character can be processed.
