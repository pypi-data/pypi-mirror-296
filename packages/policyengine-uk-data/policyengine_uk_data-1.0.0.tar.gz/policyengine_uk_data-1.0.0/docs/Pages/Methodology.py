In this page, we'll walk through step-by-step the process we use to create PolicyEngine's dataset.
* **Family Resources Survey**: we'll start with the FRS, looking at close it is to reality. To take an actual concrete starting point, we'll assume benefit payments are as reported in the survey.
* **FRS (+ tax-benefit model)**: we need to make sure that our tax-benefit model isn't doing anything unexpected. If we turn on simulation of taxes and benefits, does anything look unexpected? If not- great, we've turned a household survey into something useful for policy analysis. We'll also take stock here of what we're missing from reality.
* **Wealth and consumption**: the most obvious thing we're missing is wealth and consumption. We'll impute those here.
* **Fine-tuning**: we'll use reweighting to make some final adjustments to make sure our dataset is as close to reality as possible.
* **Validation**: we'll compare our dataset to the UK's official statistics, and see how we're doing.

    """First, we'll start with the FRS as-is. Skipping over the technical details for how we actually feed this data into the model (you can find that in `policyengine_uk_data/datasets/frs/`), we need to decide how we're actually going to measure 'close to reality'. We need to define an objective function, and if our final dataset improves it a lot, we can call that a success.
         
We'll define this objective function using public statistics that we can generally agree are of high importance to describing the UK household sector. These are things that, if the survey gets them wrong, we'd expect to cause inaccuracy in our model, and if we get them all mostly right, we'd expect to have confidence that it's a pretty accurate tax-benefit model.
         
For this, we've gone through and collected:
         
* **Demographics** from the ONS: ten-year age band populations by region of the UK, national family type populations and national tenure type populations.
* **Incomes** from HMRC: for each of 14 total income bands, the number of people with income and combined income of the seven income types that account for over 99% of total income: employment, self-employment, State Pension, private pension, property, savings interest, and dividends.
* **Tax-benefit programs** from the DWP and OBR: statistics on caseloads, expenditures and revenues for all 20 major tax-benefit programs.
         
Let's first take a look at the initial FRS, our starting point, and what is generally considered the best dataset to use (mostly completely un-modified across major tax-benefit models), and see how close it is to reproducing these statistics.
         
The table below shows the result, and: it's really quite bad! Look at the relative errors.

* Demogaphics look basically fine: that's expected, because the DWP applies an optimisation algorithm to optimise the household weights to be as close as possible to a similar set of demographic statistics. It's a good sign that we use slightly different statistics than it was trained on and get good accuracy.
* Incomes look *not great at all*. We'll take a closer look below to understand why. But the FRS is well-known to under-report income significantly.
* Tax-benefit programs also look *not good*. And this is a concern! Because we're using this dataset to answer questions about tax-benefit programs, and the FRS isn't even providing a good representation of them under baseline law.

* Some income types are severely under-estimated across all bands: notably capital incomes. This probably reflects issues with the survey questionnaire design more than sampling bias.

So, what's happening here seems like: the FRS just doesn't have enough high-income records for calibration to work straight away. The optimiser can't just set really high weights for the few rich people we do have, because it'd hurt performance on the demographic statistics.
         
So, we need a solution to add more high-income records. What we'll do is:
         
* Train a QRF model to predict the distributions of income variables from the Survey of Personal Incomes from FRS demographic variables.
* For each FRS person, add an 'imputed income' clone with zero weight.
