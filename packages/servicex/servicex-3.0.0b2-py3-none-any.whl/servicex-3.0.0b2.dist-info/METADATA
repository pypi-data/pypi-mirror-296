# servicex_client
Python SDK and CLI Client for ServiceX

## Configuration
The client relies on a YAML file to obtain the URLs of different servicex
deployments, as well as tokens to authenticate with the service. The file 
should be named `.servicex` and the format of this file is as follows:
```yaml
api_endpoints:
  - endpoint: http://localhost:5000
    name: localhost

  - endpoint: https://servicex-release-testing-4.servicex.ssl-hep.org
    name: testing4
    token: ...

default_endpoint: testing4

cache_path: /tmp/ServiceX_Client/cache-dir
shortened_downloaded_filename: true

```
The `default_endpoint` will be used if otherwise not specified. The cache 
database and downloaded files will be stored in the directory specified by 
`cache_path`.

The `shortened_downloaded_filename` property controls whether downloaded files
will have their names shortened for convenience. Setting to false preserves
the full filename from the dataset.
`

The library will search for this file in the current working directory and then
start looking in parent directories until a file is found.

## Command Line Interface
When installed, the client provides a new command in your shell, `servicex`.
This command uses a series of subcommands to work with various functions of
serviceX.

Common command line arguments:

| Flag | Long Flag | What it does                                         |
|------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| -u   | --url     | The url of the serviceX ingress                      |
| -b   | --backend | Named backend from the .servicex file endpoints list |

If neither url nor backend are specified then the client will attempt to use the
`default_endpoint` value to determine who to talk to.

### codegens 
This command will list the code generators deployed.

### transforms
These commands interact with transforms that have been run

#### list
List transforms associated with the current user. Add the `--complete` flag to
only show transforms that have completed.

#### files
List the files along with their size generated by a transform. Specify the 
transform request id with the `-t` or `--transform-id` flag

#### download
Download the files from a transform to a local directory. Specify the transform
request id with `-t` and the directory to download to with `-d`. Defaults to
downloading files to the current working directory.

### cache
These commands allow you to work with the query cache maintained by the serviceX
client.

#### list
Show all of the cached transforms along with the run time, code generator, and 
number of resulting files

#### delete
Delete a specific transform from the cache. Provide the transform request ID 
with the `-t` or `--transform-id` arg.

#### clear
Clear all of the transforms from the cache. Add `-y` to force the operation 
without confirming with the console.

## Python SDK
Entry to the SDK starts with constructing an instance of ServiceXClient.  The 
constructor accepts `backend` argument to specify a named backend from the
`.servicex` file, or `url` for the direct URL to a serviceX server. With the 
URL option you can't provide a token from `.servicex` so it must either be an
unsecured endpoint, or the token must be provided via the WLCG standard of a 
file pointed to by `BEARER_TOKEN_FILE` environment variable.

With an instance of ServiceXClient you can 
- List the code generators deployed with the ServiceX instance
- List the transformers that have been run
- Get the current status of a specific transform

### Create a Dataset Instance to Run Transforms
The ServiceX client also can create a `Dataset` instance that 
allows you to specify a query, provide a dataset identifier,
and retrieve the results of the resulting transform request.

There are two types of datasets
- func_adl_dataset
- Python Function dataset

### Dataset Identifiers
Before we get too deeply into the dataset classes, we should look
at how to specify a dataset.
- RucioDatasetIdentifier - for retrieving data files registered with Rucio
- FileListDataset - A list of URIs for accessing files using xRootd

### FuncADL Dataset
This dataset is controlled by the func_adl language. The dataset
supports the `Select`, `SelectMany`, `Where`, `MetaData`, and `QMetaData` 
operators from func_adl.


### Datasets
This is the abstract class for requesting data from ServiceX. You have to 
specify the dataset identifier you want data from and provide some sort of 
selection query. You can set the result format with the `set_result_format` 
operator (it's also a factory method arg for the dataset).

Operators that cause the client to interact with the server: These terminal 
operators will call out to the serviceX server and process results. They
are all implemented as asynchronous coroutines, but they also come with 
synchronous versions to make it easy to do easy things.
