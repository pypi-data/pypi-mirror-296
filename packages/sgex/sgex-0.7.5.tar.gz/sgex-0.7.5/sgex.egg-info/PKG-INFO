## Introduction

Sketch Grammar Explorer is an API wrapper for [Sketch Engine](https://www.sketchengine.eu/), a corpus management software useful for linguistic research. The goal is to build a flexible scaffold for any kind of programmatic work with Sketch Engine and [NoSketch Engine](https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske).

## Installation

Clone SGEX or install it with `pip install sgex` (main dependencies are `pandas pyyaml aiohttp aiofiles`).

Get a [Sketch Engine API key](https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/api-documentation/#toggle-id-1). Be sure to reference SkE's documentation and schema:

`wget https://www.sketchengine.eu/apidoc/openapi.yaml -O .openapi.yaml`

## Getting started

A quick intro on the API (examples use a local NoSketch Engine server).

>Most things are identical for SkE's main server, apart from using credentials and more call types being available. SGEX currently uses the Bonito API, with URLs ending in `/bonito/run.cgi`, not newer paths like `/search/corp_info`.

### Package modules

- `job`: the primary module - makes requests and manipulates data
- `call`: classes and methods for API call types
- `query`: functions to generate/manipulate CQL queries
- `util`: utility functions

### The Job class

Calls are made with the `job` module, which can also be run as a script. The `Job` class has a few options:

```py
from sgex.job import Job

j = Job(
	# define API calls
	infile: str | list | None = None,
	params: str | dict | list | None = None,
	# set server info
	server: str = "local",
	default_servers: dict = default_servers,
	# supply credentials
	api_key: str | None = None,
	username: str | None = None,
	# manage caching
	cache_dir: str = "data",
	clear_cache: bool = False,
	# run asynchronous requests
	thread: bool = False,
	# control request throttling
	wait_dict: dict = wait_dict,
	# make a dry run
	dry_run: bool = False,
	# change verbosity
	verbose: bool = False,
	)

j.run()
```
