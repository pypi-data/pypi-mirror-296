# **QuantStream**

QuantStream is a Python-based financial modeling platform designed to interact with real-time financial data via APIs, including the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API. The platform provides tools for model training, real-time data integration, and visualization.

## **Features**
- **API Wrapper**: Integration with the FMP API for fetching financial data.
- **Model Training**: Train models using financial data directly within the platform.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Display and interact with real-time financial data.
- **Data Export**: Download financial data in various formats such as CSV.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new models or financial data providers.

## **Installation**

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- `uv` package for environment and dependency management
- `ruff` for linting

### **Setup**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantstream.git
   cd quantstream
   ```

2. Install `uv` and sync dependencies:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.astral.sh | sh
   uv sync --all-extras --dev
   ```

3. Set up the environment variable for your API key:

   ```bash
   export FMP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m quantstream
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Train a Model**

```bash
uv run python -m quantstream.train_model --symbol AAPL --model linear
```

This command trains a linear model for Apple Inc. using real-time financial data.

### **Get Real-Time Data**

```bash
uv run python -m quantstream.fetch_data --symbol AAPL
```

Fetches the latest financial data for Apple Inc. from the FMP API.

### **Visualize Data**

The platform comes with visualization tools for real-time financial data. You can run the visualization module using:

```bash
uv run python -m quantstream.visualize --symbol AAPL
```

## **Development Workflow**

### **Code Style and Linting**

We use `ruff` for code linting. You can check for any style issues by running:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

### **Running Tests**

Tests are managed using `pytest`. You can run all tests with:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

### **Pre-commit Hooks**

This project uses `pre-commit` hooks to enforce code quality. Install the hooks by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
