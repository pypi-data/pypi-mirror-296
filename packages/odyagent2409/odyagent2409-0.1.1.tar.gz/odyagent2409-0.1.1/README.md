### Files

- `src/cli_jgmarxiv.py`: This file contains a CLI tool for researching terms in the ArXiv database using LangChain. It interacts with the `arxiv_agent` to retrieve results and provides functions for serializing the response to JSON and Markdown formats.

- `src/shell_agent.py`: This file contains an agent that has access to ShellTool and can execute useful actions in the current system. It provides functions for executing shell commands and interacting with the system.

- `src/agents/arxiv_agent.py`: This file exports the `ArxivAgent` class, which interacts with LangChain and the ArXiv database to research terms. It may use the `ShellAgent` to execute shell commands if needed.

- `src/agents/shell_agent.py`: This file exports the `ShellAgent` class, which provides an interface for executing shell commands and interacting with the system. It can be used by other agents or CLI tools that require shell access.

- `tests/test_cli_jgmarxiv.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `cli_jgmarxiv` module. It tests the functionality of the CLI tool and the serialization functions.

- `tests/test_shell_agent.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `shell_agent` module. It tests the functionality of the `ShellAgent` class and its ability to execute shell commands.

- `.copilot-instructions.md`: This file contains instructions for GitHub Copilot. It is not directly related to the functionality of the project.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required by the project. It specifies the Python packages and their versions.

- `setup.py`: This file is used for packaging and distributing the project. It includes metadata about the project and its dependencies.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

Please refer to the individual files for more details on their implementation and usage.
