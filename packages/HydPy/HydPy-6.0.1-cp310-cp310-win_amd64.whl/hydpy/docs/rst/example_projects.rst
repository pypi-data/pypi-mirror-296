================

We provide several example projects.  You can download them to familiarize yourself
with HydPy's project structure, try out the tutorials, or freely experiment with more
advanced features.  Note that all example projects are also included in each HydPy
release.  We use them to explain and test HydPy in several documentation sections.

HydPy-H-Lahn
____________

`HydPy-H-Lahn` is a complete project data set for the German river Lahn, provided by
the `German Federal Institute of Hydrology (BfG)`_.  The Lahn is a medium-sized
tributary to the Rhine.  The given project configuration agrees with the BfG's
forecasting model, using HBV96 to simulate the inflow of the Rhine's tributaries.  The
catchment consists of four sub-catchments, each with a river gauge (Marburg, Asslar,
Leun, Kalkofen) at its outlet.  The sub-catchments consist of a different number of
zones.
