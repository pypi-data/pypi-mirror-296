# HoopStats

`hoopstats` can be accessed [here](https://pypi.org/project/hoopstats/) on PyPi.

This project serves as a proof of concept (POC) for web scraping NBA data from Basketball Reference. The primary motivation is to explore the intersection of data science and software engineering by building a reliable NBA-focused Python package. The long-term objective of this project is to evolve into the backend of a full-stack application, providing users with seamless access to NBA statistics through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Installation

Install the package using the following command:

```python
pip install hoopstats
```
