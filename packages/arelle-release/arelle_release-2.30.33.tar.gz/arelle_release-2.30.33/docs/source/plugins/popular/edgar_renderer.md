## Overview

The [EDGAR Renderer][github] plugin, developed and maintained by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), is designed to provide traditional and inline XBRL viewers for SEC filings. It also integrates with
and extends the [EFM Validation plugin][validate-efm], offering EFM validation for SEC filings. For end-user support,
please contact the SEC directly at: [StructuredData@sec.gov][sec-email].

## Key Features

- **XBRL Viewers**: Offers both traditional and inline XBRL viewers for SEC filings.
- **EFM Validation**: Integrates with the EFM Validation plugin for comprehensive SEC filing validation.

## Example Command Line Usage

To validate an SEC filing:
