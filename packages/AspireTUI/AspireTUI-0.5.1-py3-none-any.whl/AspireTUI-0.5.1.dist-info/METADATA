Brief
-----
ASPIRE is a Python 3.11+ module that offers an easy to use line-based text user interface framework.

It aims to make the console output more appealing to end users and provide developers an easy to use framework for 'everyday tasks' and to put their output left, center and right oriented with some 'dividers' (header, title) using a theme for presentation.

> __Note:__\
> The original BASH version was only using internal BASH functionality and GNU Core Utils, I intend to only rely on Python standard library for this framework as well. \
> __No depency hell!__ *But I might need to "*re-invent the wheel*" for certain functions.* -> However, during WIP phases, I might rely on additional libs until my mind is ready to do so.


Target Audience
---------------
For developers aiming to enhance the user experience with the console.

![HelloWorld](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/Aspire/blob/master/docs/img/HelloWorld.jpg?raw=true)


Detail
------

ASPIRE is designed with simplified usability in mind for both end users and developers. \
These functions aim to streamline interactions and improve the overall experience, coding and usage wise.

It aims to be cross platform compatible, but this will also require you to handle certain cases in your own code.

### It supports:
* Any console that can run Python code.\
Like:
	* MS Windows (regular + PowerShell)
	* Any GNU + *nix system/distro \
	As a side effect this (partialy) includes:
		* Apple iOS


Usage & Preview
---------------

___Please see [help](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/Aspire/blob/master/docs/Help.md) and [examples](https://github.com/sri-arjuna/Aspire/blob/master/docs/examples) for detailed information.___

The code for the previous preview would look as simple as this, which is how you can use it as library in your projects:

```py
from AspireTUI import tui
from AspireTUI import Strings as _stew

tui.header("Aspire by (sea/sri-arjuna)", "{_stew.now()}")
tui.title("Hello World")
tui.print("Left string", "Center string", "Right string")
tui.wait(3)
tui.press()
```

This is how "Hello World" (using ``header``, ``title`` and ``print``) can look like:

Here's just a screenshot of how "data" or "progress" could be shown to your users, or how they could interact with your programm.
