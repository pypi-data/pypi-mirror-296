**CellRank** is a modular framework to study cellular dynamics based on Markov state modeling of
multi-view single-cell data. See our `documentation`_, and the `CellRank 1`_ and `CellRank 2 manuscript`_ to learn more.
See `here <https://github.com/theislab/cellrank/blob/main/docs/about/cite.rst>`_ for how to properly cite our work.

CellRank scales to large cell numbers, is fully compatible with the `scverse`_ ecosystem, and easy to use.
In the backend, it is powered by `pyGPCCA`_ (`Reuter et al. (2018)`_). Feel
free to open an `issue`_ or send us an `email`_ if you encounter a bug, need our help or just
want to make a comment/suggestion.

CellRank's key applications
---------------------------
- Estimate differentiation direction based on a varied number of biological priors, including RNA velocity
  (`La Manno et al. (2018)`_, `Bergen et al. (2020)`_), any pseudotime or developmental potential,
  experimental time points, metabolic labels, and more.
- Compute initial, terminal and intermediate macrostates.
- Infer fate probabilities and driver genes.
- Visualize and cluster gene expression trends.
- ... and much more, check out our `documentation`_.
