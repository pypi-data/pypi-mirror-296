Version: 1.3.1
Summary: A Python package to translate po files using LLMs. Implements ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok and Ollama clients. (Note: Grok implemented but not tested yet as Grok API is not yet available in my country). Uses a 1rst manual translation for desambiguating short PO pieces of sentences.

# Goal of this project
This project aims at using different LLMs to help translating po files using a first already translated file.

For instance, you have a .po file containing msgids in English and msgstrs in French: using this file, you can ask the tool to tranlate the .po file to any other language. The first translation helps at disambiguating the very short sentences or part of sentences usually found in .po files.

This can work with OpenAI (provided you have an OpenAI API key) or Anthropic Claude (provided you have an Anthropic AIP key) or Ollama (here, you'll run your Ollama server locally and be able to use any model that Ollama can run - depending obviously on your hardware capabilities, and that for free!).

# Install

## Prerequisite
* You must have python>=3.10 installed 
* While not required, it is highly recommended that you create a python virtual env, if you don't already have one, using pipenv or conda or whatever virtual env manager you prefer. eg:
   `conda create -n auto_po_lyglot python=3.10 && conda activate auto_po_lyglot`
or
   `python -m venv ~/auto_po_lyglot && source ~/auto_po_lyglot/bin/activate`

## Install from PyPi
* Install the module from PyPi:
   `pip install --upgrade auto_po_lyglot`

## Install from sources
1. Fork the repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/leolivier/transpo.git auto_po_lyglot`
1. cd to the auto_po_lyglot folder and install the package and its dependencies: 
   `cd auto_po_lyglot && pip install .`

# Configuration
auto_po_lyglot uses a mix of command line arguments and `.env` file to be as flexible as possible;

Most parameters can be given directly on the command line (if not using the UI version), but you can put in a `.env` file all parameters that don't change very often and use the command line only to override their values when needed.

## `.env` file
The `.env` file can be created by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
`cp .env.example .env`
Then edit the `.env` file and adapt it to your needs. Specifically:
* choose your default LLM and if you dont want to use the predefined default models for the chosen LLM, specify the model you want to use.
  Variables are:
    * `LLM_CLIENT`: possible values are 'ollama', 'openai', 'claude' or 'claude_cached' (claude_cached is advantageous for very big system prompts ie more than 1024 tokens with sonnet)
    * `LLM_MODEL`: default models are gpt-4o-2024-08-06 for OpenAI, claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 for claude and claude_cached, llama3.1:8b for ollama.
    * `TEMPERATURE`: the temperature provided to the LLM. Default is 0.2
  If you choose OpenAI our Claude, you can also put in the .env file the API keys for the LLM:
    * `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI
    * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude
* Usually, the language of the msgids and the one for the initial translation of the msgstrs will always be the same based on your own language knowledge. Especially if your native language is not English, you will probably use English as your source language and your native language as your 1st translation. Variables are:
  * `ORIGINAL_LANGUAGE` for the language used in msgids
  * `CONTEXT_LANGUAGE` for the langauge used in the 1rst translation
  * `TARGET_LANGUAGES` is a comma separated list of languages in which the .po file must be translated. Usually provide by the command line
* also, this is the place where you can tune the prompt for the LLM. The default ones provided work quite well, but if you can do better, please open a PR and provide your prompt with the LLM on which you tested it and attach the original and translated .po files;
  Variables used are `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `USER_PROMPT`.
* `LOG_LEVEL` sets the log level (values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). This can be overriden on the command line (-v = INFO, -vv = DEBUG)
* `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: the URL to access the Ollama server (if used). The default is `http://localhost:11434/v1` for using a local Ollama server. If your server uses a different URL, please specify it here. There is no command line argument to this parameter.

# Run it:
## Running with the UI
> From version 1.3.0

First create a short python script named `auto_po_lyglot_ui.py` containing these 2 lines:
```
from auto_po_lyglot.po_streamlit import streamlit_main
streamlit_main()
```
And run `streamlit run auto_po_lyglot_ui.py`
Then, you can go to http://localhost:8501 and provide the necessary parameters. Most of them can be initialized based on the content of the .env file. A help button (with a '?') explains what to provide where.

## Running from the Command Line
**Usage:** `auto_po_lyglot [-h] [-p] [-l LLM] [-m MODEL] [-t TEMPERATURE] [--original_language ORIGINAL_LANGUAGE] [--context_language CONTEXT_LANGUAGE]
                     [--target_language TARGET_LANGUAGE] [-i INPUT_PO] [-o OUTPUT_PO] [-v] [-vv]`
