## TODO

- use as much magic/logic as possible to the backend - especially the prompts
- make it great, test the demand with this before making the plugin
- save all answers like ignore perm
- make the user control the config via remote settings
- classify query prompts and enhance the prompt based on the classification
- save original files
- improve print statements
- improve error handling
- search for git root
