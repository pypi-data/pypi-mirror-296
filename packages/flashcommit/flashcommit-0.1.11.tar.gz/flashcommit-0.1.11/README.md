## How to build

Install editable installation:
```pip install -e .```

## TODO

- use as much magic/logic as possible to the backend - especially the prompts
- make it great, test the demand with this before making the plugin
- save all answers like ignore perm
- make the user control the config via remote settings
- classify query prompts and enhance the prompt based on the classification
