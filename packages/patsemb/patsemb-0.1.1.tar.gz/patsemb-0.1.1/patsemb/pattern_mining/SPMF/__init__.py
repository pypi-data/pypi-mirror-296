Frequent, sequential patterns are sequential patterns that often
occur in the set of symbolic words. This ensures that the mined
patterns are correspond to typical shapes of the time series. Extensive
research in frequent pattern mining resulted in numerous pattern-mining
algorithms. We rely on the SPMF-library [FLGG16]_ to mine frequent
sequential patterns.
