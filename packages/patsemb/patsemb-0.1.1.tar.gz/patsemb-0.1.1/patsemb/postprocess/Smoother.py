class Smoother(Postprocessor):
    """
    Apply temporal smoothing on the embedding matrix. Temporal smoothing
    will transform each column in the embedding matrix by taking the weighted
    average of that column and the neighboring columns. This ensures that the
    consecutive time steps have more similar values.

    Specifically, the transformation of column i in embedding matrix E with
    normalized weights W equals:

        E[:, i] = ... + W[1] * E[:, i-1] + W[0] * E[:, i] + W[1] * E[:, i+1] + ...

    Parameters
    ----------
    nb_iterations: int, default=1
        The number of times smoothing will be applied. This value must be at
        least 1.
    weights: np.array of shape (size_neighborhood,)
        The weights used for aggregating the columns. The first weight corresponds
        to the weight of the current column, the other weights correspond to the
        weights of neighboring columns. The weights are interpreted to be relative
        and will be normalized during smoothing. At least two weights must be provided.
        None of the weights can be negative.
