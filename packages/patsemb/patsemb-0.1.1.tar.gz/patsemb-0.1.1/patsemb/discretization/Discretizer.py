class Discretizer(abc.ABC):
    """
    Convert a time series to a series of symbolic subsequences, in which
    each subsequence consists of a number of discrete symbols. This is
    achieved by iterating over a time series using a sliding window
    (with given window size and stride), and subsequently convert each
    subsequence to a discrete representation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_size: int
        The length of the sliding window, i.e., the sizes of the windows
        to convert to symbolic subsequences.
    stride: int
        The stride for the sliding window, i.e., the amount of time staps
        by which the sliding window shifts to extract the next window.

        Parameters
        ----------

        symbolic_subsequences: np.ndarray of size (n_symbolic_sequences, length_symbolic_sequences)

            representing a different symbolic subsequence.
