class SPMF(PatternMiner, abc.ABC):
    """
    Mine frequent sequential patterns in the discrete representation
    of some time series. This is based on the SPMF-library, which is
    a package consisting of many sequential pattern mining algorithms.
    This class serves as a wrapper approach for the jar-file with the
    source code for the algorithms.

    """

    def mine(self, discrete_sequences: np.ndarray, y=None) -> List[np.array]:
        """
        Mine frequent sequential patterns in the given symbolic representation
        of the time series. First, the discrete subsequences are written to a
        temporary file, which serves as input to the SPMF-library. Second, a
        command is constructed and called to use the SPMF-library for mining
        patterns. Finally, the patterns are read from the file to which the
        SPMF-library writes the mined patterns, and the temporary files are
        removed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        discrete_sequences: np.array of shape (n_symbolic_sequences, length_symbolic_sequences)
            The discrete representation of a time series. This representation
            consists of ´n_symbolic_sequences´ subsequences, each one having
            ´length_symbolic_sequences´ symbols. The sequences are provided
            as the rows of the given input matrix.
        y: Ignored
            Not used, present here for API consistency by convention.

        Returns
        -------
        patterns: List[np.array]
            The mined, frequent sequential patterns
