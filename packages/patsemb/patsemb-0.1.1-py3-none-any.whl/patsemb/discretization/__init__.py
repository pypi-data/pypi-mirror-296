
"""
This module provides the functionality to convert a time series into a symbolic representation.
and can be imported as follows:

>>> from patsemb import discretization

The symbolic representation of a time series is a set of symbolic words, constructed using a
fixed size alphabet. Because the symbolic words do not consist of continuous values (which is
the case for time series), they are suitable for mining sequential patterns.
