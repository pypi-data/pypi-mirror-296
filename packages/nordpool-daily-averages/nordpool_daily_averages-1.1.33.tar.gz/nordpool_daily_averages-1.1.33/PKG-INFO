Python package for querying nordpool for average daily and hourly prices per kWh.
Prices can only be obtained for the current year and the previous year.
Incremet is how much you need to add to the price if you chargeback someone per kWh. It's optional and the default is zero.

```python
#Getting average price for 2024-08-30, for areacode SE3 and in Euro and 15 cents is added to the prices
from nordpool import Daily as daily
#instantiate class
price = daily("SE3", "EUR", "0.15")
#Get the price
price.get_prices_for_one_date("2024-08-30")
```

```python
#Getting average price for 2024-08-29 for areacode SE3 in SEK and 15 Ã¶re is added to the prices
from nordpool import Daily as daily

price = daily("SE3", "SEK", "0.15")
#Get the price
price.get_prices_for_one_date("2024-08-29")
```

```python

#instantiate class
price = daily("SE2", "SEK")
#Get the price
price.get_prices_for_one_date("2024-08-28")
```

```python
#Getting all price's for current year and last year for areacode SE2 in SEK and no increment is added to the prices
from nordpool import Daily as daily
#instantiate class
price = daily("SE2", "SEK")
#Get all price's
price.get_all_prices()
```

```python
import asyncio
from nordpool import Hourly as hour
#Getting hourly data prices for one date
async def main():
