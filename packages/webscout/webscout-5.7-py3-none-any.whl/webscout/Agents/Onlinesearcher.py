        Task: Generate {num_queries} optimal search queries based on the given information.

        Instructions:
        1. Analyze the provided information carefully.
        2. Identify key concepts, entities, and relationships.
        3. Formulate {num_queries} concise and specific search queries that will yield relevant results.
        4. Each query should focus on a different aspect or angle of the information.
        5. The queries should be in natural language, not in the form of keywords.
        6. Avoid unnecessary words or phrases that might limit the search results.

        Your response must be in the following JSON format:
        {{
            "search_queries": [
                "Your first search query here",
                "Your second search query here",
                "Your third search query here"
            ]
        }}

        Ensure that:
        - You provide exactly {num_queries} search queries.
        - Each query is unique and focuses on a different aspect of the information.
        - The queries are in plain text, suitable for a web search engine.

        Information to base the search queries on:
        {information}

        Now, generate the optimal search queries:
