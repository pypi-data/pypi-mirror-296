**GitSherlock** is your one-stop shop for analyzing and understanding GitHub repositories! 💥 Allowing you to dive deep into any repository's structure, content, and functionality. 🔭

### ⚡ What can GitSherlock do? ⚡

* **Validate GitHub repository URLs:**  Ensure you're looking at the right codebase! 🔐
* **Summarize the repository:** No need to read the entire README, GitSherlock will do that for you. 😉
* **Generate a file tree:**  Visually explore the repository's directory structure. 🌳
* **Analyze individual files:**  Get descriptions and function breakdowns for supported file types (including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more!). 🧠
* **Display repository details:**  Get important information like the owner, number of stars, forks, open issues, and language. ✨
* **Interactive mode:**  Analyze multiple repositories without leaving the terminal! 💻
