# Telepager

No need to code pagination yourself again and again.

```bash
pip install telepager
# or

poetry add telepager
```

Telepager works both with [telegrinder](https://github.com/timoniq/telegrinder) and [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram)

Look at [examples](./examples). They give both basic knowdedge of telepager and advanced usage too.
