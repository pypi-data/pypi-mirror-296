## Typing stubs for influxdb-client

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`influxdb-client`](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`influxdb-client`.

This version of `types-influxdb-client` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `influxdb-client==1.45.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/influxdb-client. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Note: `types-influxdb-client` has required `urllib3>=2` since v1.37.0.1. If you need to install `types-influxdb-client` into an environment that must also have `urllib3<2` installed into it, you will have to use `types-influxdb-client<1.37.0.1`.

*Note:* The `influxdb-client` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 1.46.0. Please uninstall the `types-influxdb-client`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
