# MIMDE: Consultation Analysis Toolkit

The Consultation Analysis Toolkit (CAT) is a set of tools for extracting insights from government consultations. This toolkit takes as input a machine-readable consultation dataset in tabular format, with one row per response and one or more columns per question. Methods for non-tabular data may be available in a future version. The output of this toolkit is two paired datasets: one containing the extracted insights for each free-text question and the other containing the thematic tagging of responses for each extracted insight.

- Visualization: MIMDE provides powerful visualization capabilities to help you explore and understand your data. You can create various types of plots, charts, and graphs to visualize your analysis results.

## Installation

To install MIMDE, simply run the following command:

```
pip install mimde
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started with MIMDE:

```python
import mimde

# Load your dataset
data = mimde.load_dataset('my_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data
preprocessed_data = mimde.preprocess(data)

# Perform statistical analysis
results = mimde.analyze(preprocessed_data)

# Train a machine learning model
model = mimde.train_model(preprocessed_data)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = mimde.evaluate_model(model, preprocessed_data)

# Visualize the results
mimde.plot_results(results)
```
