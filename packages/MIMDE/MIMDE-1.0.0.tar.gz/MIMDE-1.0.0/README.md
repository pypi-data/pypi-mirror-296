pip install mimde
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started with MIMDE:

```python
import mimde

# Load your dataset
data = mimde.load_dataset('my_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data
preprocessed_data = mimde.preprocess(data)

# Perform statistical analysis
results = mimde.analyze(preprocessed_data)

# Train a machine learning model
model = mimde.train_model(preprocessed_data)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = mimde.evaluate_model(model, preprocessed_data)

# Visualize the results
mimde.plot_results(results)
```
