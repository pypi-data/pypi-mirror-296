## Changelog

### 0.1.0

First release of `sopel-npm` with:

* `npmjs.com` package link handling, with and without a version number
* `.npm` command for text search of packages in the registry

Known issues:

* Packages' publication times are not displayed, because the NPM registry's
  package-version endpoint inexplicably does not provide a release timestamp.
* While all of the error-handling code paths _should_ work, in theory, some
  haven't been verified in real-life testing yet.
