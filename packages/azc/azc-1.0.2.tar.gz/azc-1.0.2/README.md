  - Ollama
  - OpenAI
  - Anthropic
- Streaming responses
- Persistent command-line history
- Chat history & reset (start new chat)
- Switch provider and model
- Markdown output

# Possible future features

- Support for more LLM providers
- Support RTL languages
- Save output to file
- Patterns library
- Upload files
- Support more modes (image generation, transcription, etc.)
- Automated testing?

# Installation

    pip install azc

# Running

    % azc
    azc> how tall is the eifel tower?
    openai:gpt-4o-mini: The Eiffel Tower is approximately 1,083 feet (330 meters) tall, including its antennas. The structure itself, without antennas, is about 1,063 feet (324 meters).
    azc> q
    Bye!
    %

    You can specify the first prompt as a command-line argument:

    % azc "what is the capital of the moon?"
    openai:gpt-4o-mini: The capital of the moon is called "New Moon".
    azc>

# Commands

- `q` or `exit` - exit the program
- `h` or `?` - show help
- `l` - list models
- `n` - start new chat
- `p` - Change provider
- `m` - Change model

# Setup

You will need to configure at least one LLM API.

You should create a `.env` file which contains your API Key/s.

See `.env.sample` for a sample file

Here are the links to the API sign-up pages (or download in case of Ollama):
