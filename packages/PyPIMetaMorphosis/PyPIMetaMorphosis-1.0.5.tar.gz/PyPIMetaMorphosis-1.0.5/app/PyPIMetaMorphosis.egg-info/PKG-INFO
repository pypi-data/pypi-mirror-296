# PyPIMetaMorphosis

This project creates a PyPI-ready project structure automatically using Python. It simplifies the process of building and organizing files for Python packages, including setting up a folder structure, creating essential files like `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `setup.py`, and initializing directories like `src`, `test`, and `app`.
