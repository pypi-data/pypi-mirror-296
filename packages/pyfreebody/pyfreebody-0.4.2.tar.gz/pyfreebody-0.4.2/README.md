*Generate free-body diagrams with ease using Python!*

---

## Introduction

**pyfreebody** is a Python package that simplifies the creation of free-body diagrams for physics and engineering applications. Whether you're a student learning mechanics, a teacher preparing course materials, or an engineer visualizing forces, **pyfreebody** makes it easy to generate and customize free-body diagrams programmatically.

---

## Features

- ðŸŒŸ **Easy to Use**: Simple API for creating bodies and adding forces.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable Diagrams**: Adjust colors, labels, and styles to fit your needs.
- ðŸ§­ **Supports Inclined Planes**: Handle basic systems and inclined planes effortlessly.
- ðŸŽ² **Randomized Colors**: Automatically generate visually distinct force vectors.
- ðŸ’¾ **Save and Display Diagrams**: Save diagrams to files or display them directly.
- ðŸ”§ **Extensible**: Built with flexibility in mind for future enhancements.

## Installation

Install **pyfreebody** using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyfreebody
```

---

## Quick Start

Here's how to create a basic free-body diagram:

```python
from pyfreebody import Freebody, Direction

# Create a free-body diagram for a block
fb = Freebody(name="Block", mass=10)

# Add forces acting on the block
fb.addForce(name="Gravity", magnitude=98.1, theta=Direction.down)
fb.addForce(name="Normal", magnitude=98.1, theta=Direction.up)
fb.addForce(name="Applied Force", magnitude=50, theta=Direction.right)
fb.addForce(name="Friction", magnitude=30, theta=Direction.left)

# Generate and display the diagram
fb.diagram()
```

This code will generate a free-body diagram of a block with gravitational, normal, applied, and frictional forces.
