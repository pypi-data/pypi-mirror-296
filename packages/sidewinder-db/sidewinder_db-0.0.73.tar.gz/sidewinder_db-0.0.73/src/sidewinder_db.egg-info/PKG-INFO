Python-based Distributed Database

### Note: Sidewinder is experimental - and is not intended for Production workloads. 

Sidewinder is a [Python](https://python.org)-based (with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)) Proof-of-Concept Distributed Database that distributes shards of data from the server to a number of workers to "divide and conquer" OLAP database workloads.

It consists of a server, workers, and a client (where you can run interactive SQL commands).

Sidewinder will NOT distribute queries which do not contain aggregates - it will run those on the server side. 

Sidewinder uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) with [Websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with TLS for secure communication between the server, worker(s), and client(s).  

It uses [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) as its SQL execution engine - and the PostgreSQL parser to understand how to combine results from distributed workers.

# Setup (to run locally)

## Install package
You can install `sidewinder-db` from PyPi or from source.

### Option 1 - from PyPi
```shell
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate

pip install sidewinder-db
```

### Option 2 - from source - for development
```shell
git clone https://github.com/prmoore77/sidewinder

cd sidewinder

# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install Sidewinder-DB - in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install --editable .[dev]
```

### Note
For the following commands - if you running from source and using `--editable` mode (for development purposes) - you will need to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable as follows:
```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src
```

## Bootstrap the environment by creating a security user list (password file), TLS certificate keypair, and a sample TPC-H dataset with 11 shards
### (The passwords shown are just examples, it is recommended that you use more secure passwords)
```shell
. .venv/bin/activate
sidewinder-bootstrap \
    --client-username=scott \
    --client-password=tiger \
    --worker-password=united \
    --tpch-scale-factor=1 \
    --shard-count=11
```

## Run sidewinder locally - from root of repo (use --help option on the executables below for option details)


### 1) Server:
#### Open a terminal, then:
```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
sidewinder-server
```

### 2) Worker:
#### Open another terminal, then start a single worker (using the same worker password you used in the bootstrap command above) with command:
```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
sidewinder-worker --tls-roots=tls/server.crt --password=united
```
##### Note: you can run up to 11 workers for this example configuration, to do that do this instead of starting a single-worker:
```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
for x in {1..11}:
do
  sidewinder-worker --tls-roots=tls/server.crt --password=united &
done
```

To kill the workers later - run:
```bash
kill $(jobs -p)
```

### 3) Client:
#### Open another terminal, then connect with the client - using the same client username/password you used in the bootstrap command above:
```
. .venv/bin/activate
sidewinder-client --tls-roots=tls/server.crt --username=scott --password=tiger
```

##### Then - while in the client - you can run a sample query that will distribute to the worker(s) (if you have at least one running) - example:
```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lineitem;```
##### Note: if you are running less than 11 workers - your answer will only reflect n/11 of the data (where n is the worker count).  We will add delta processing at a later point...

##### A query that won't distribute (because it does not contain aggregates) - would be:
```SELECT * FROM region;```
##### or:
```SELECT * FROM lineitem LIMIT 5;```

##### Note: there are TPC-H queries in the [tpc-h_queries](tpc-h_queries) folder you can run...

##### To turn distributed mode OFF in the client:
```.set distributed = false;```

##### To turn summarization mode OFF in the client (so that sidewinder does NOT summarize the workers' results - this only applies to distributed mode):
```.set summarize = false;```

### Optional DuckDB CLI (use for data QA purposes, etc.)
Install DuckDB CLI version [1.1.0](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - and make sure the executable is on your PATH.

Platform Downloads:   
[Linux x86-64](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v1.1.0/duckdb_cli-linux-amd64.zip)   
[Linux arm64 (aarch64)](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v1.1.0/duckdb_cli-linux-aarch64.zip)   
[MacOS Universal](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/download/v1.1.0/duckdb_cli-osx-universal.zip)   

### Handy development commands

#### Version management

##### Bump the version of the application - (you must have installed from source with the [dev] extras)
```bash
bumpver update --patch
```
