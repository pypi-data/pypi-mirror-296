              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

***********************************
OS-Climate Data Extraction Tool
***********************************


This project provides an CLI tool and python scripts to train a HuggingFace Transformer model or a local Transformer model and perform inference with it. The primary goal of the inference is to determine the relevance between a given question and context.

Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the OSC Transformer Based Extractor CLI, use pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install osc-transformer-based-extractor

Afterwards you can use the tooling as a CLI tool by simply typing:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ osc-transformer-based-extractor

We are using typer to have a nice CLI tool here. All details and help will be shown in the CLI
tool itself and are not described here in more detail.

**Example**: Assume the folder structure is like that:

.. code-block:: text

    project/
    │
    ├── kpi_mapping.csv
    ├── training_data.csv
    ├── data/
    │   └── (json files for inference command)
    ├── model/
    │   └── (model-related files go here)
    |── saved__model/
    |   └── (output files trained models)
    ├── output/
    │   └── (ouput files from inference command)


Then you can now simply run (after installation of osc-transformer-based-extractor)
the following command to fine-tune the model on the data:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ osc-transformer-based-extractor relevance-detector fine-tune \
    --data_path "project/training_data.csv" \
    --model_name "bert-base-uncased" \
    --num_labels 2 \
    --max_length 128 \
    --epochs 3 \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --output_dir "project/saved__model/" \
    --save_steps 500

Also, the following command can be run to perform inference:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ osc-transformer-based-extractor relevance-detector perform-inference \
    --folder_path "project/data/" \
    --kpi_mapping_path "project/kpi_mapping.csv" \
    --output_path "project/output/" \
    --model_path "project/model/" \
    --tokenizer_path "project/model/" \
    --threshold 0.5


***************
Training Data
***************

Training File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To train the model, you need a CSV file with columns:
     * ``Question``
     * ``Context``
     * ``Label``

Also additionally, the output of the https://github.com/os-climate/osc-transformer-presteps module can also be used. the output will look like following
Sample Data:

.. list-table:: traning_Data.csv
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Question
     - Context
     - Label
     - Company
     - Source File
     - Source Page
     - KPI ID
     - Year
     - Answer
     - Data Type
     - Annotator
     - Index
   * - What is the company name?
     - The Company is exposed to a risk of by losses counterparties their contractual financial obligations when due, and in particular depends on the reliability of banks the Company deposits its available cash.

     - PAO NOVATEK
     - TEXT
     - train_anno_large.xlsx
     - 1022


KPI Mapping File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Inference command will need a kpi-mapping.csv file, which looks like:

.. list-table:: kpi_mapping.csv
   :header-rows: 1

   * - kpi_id
     - question
     - sectors
     - add_year
     - kpi_category
   * - 1
     - In which year was the annual report or the sustainability report published?
     - OG, CM, CU
     - FALSE
     - TEXT




************************
Developer Notes
************************

Use code directly without CLI via Github Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First clone the repository to your local environment::

    $ git clone https://github.com/os-climate/osc-transformer-based-extractor/

We are using pdm to manage the packages and tox for a stable test framework.
Hence, first install pdm (possibly in a virtual environment) via::

    $ pip install pdm

Afterwards sync you system via::

    $ pdm sync

Now you have multiple demos on how to go on. See folder
[here](demo)

pdm
---

For adding new dependencies use pdm. You could add new packages via pdm add.
For example numpy via::

    $ pdm add numpy

For a very detailed description check the homepage of the pdm project:

https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/


tox
---

For running linting tools we use tox which you run outside of your virtual environment::

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox -e lint
    $ tox -e test

This will automatically apply some checks on your code and run the provided pytests. See
more details on tox on the homepage of the tox project:

https://tox.wiki/en/4.16.0/

Contributing
************************

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any enhancements or bug fixes.

All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1. This is exactly the same one created and used by the Linux kernel developers and posted on http://developercertificate.org/. This is a developer's certification that he or she has the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project. Simply submitting a contribution implies this agreement, however, please include a "Signed-off-by" tag in every patch (this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to the DCO).


On June 26 2024, Linux Foundation announced the merger of its financial services umbrella, the Fintech Open Source Foundation ([FINOS](https://finos.org)), with OS-Climate, an open source community dedicated to building data technologies, modeling, and analytic tools that will drive global capital flows into climate change mitigation and resilience; OS-Climate projects are in the process of transitioning to the [FINOS governance framework](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance); read more on [finos.org/press/finos-join-forces-os-open-source-climate-sustainability-esg](https://finos.org/press/finos-join-forces-os-open-source-climate-sustainability-esg)
