## 🔬 What is this?

Two lines are sufficient to express us! This Python package provides personal details just like the GitHub profile README. What you need is Python 3.8 and your own terminal. This package is build with 95% Python, only because I am born to be a python developer. Minimized dependencies to 1 to keep the environment clean, except for 'rich' which can colorize the terminal.




## ❓ Why is it needed?

> Developers tell their story through their code.

I discovered that an enormous amount of time is spent browsing profile components and selecting them. Almost every developer uses GitHub, and GitHub is for all developers. Therefore, I believe that visitors who stop by others' GitHub profiles are likely `Code-Friendly` individuals. The service is meant to build store our own code, Even so, it's too much to browse through every repository of theirs.

More importantly, some developers feel more at ease reading code rather than long description or fancy icons. So, why don't we express ourselves through our code snippet?



## 📂 How it works?

Anyone who encounters this will follow the steps below

```bash
pip install whoau
dotpie
```


### Authorizing Step
> Only for fun, But realtime update. How many visitors do you have?<br/>

In this step, the user will be assigned a specific number which refers to installation counts. After the terminal screen is cleared, localized greetings will appear.


### Greeting Step

> Customized a simple greeting message for surprise. What message did you get?

The module detects the user's operating system and local time to select the proper welcoming message. Currently, it supports 'AR', 'DE', 'ES', 'FR', 'HI', 'IT', 'JA', 'KR', 'PT', 'RU', 'US', and 'ZH'. <br/>
- Note: Local customized greetings only use Python's internal modules os and time. Your personal information is safe and not stored or leaked.
- I am trying hard not to harm your system or environment. If you find any of them, please report an [issue](https://github.com/dotpie/whoau/issues/new)
