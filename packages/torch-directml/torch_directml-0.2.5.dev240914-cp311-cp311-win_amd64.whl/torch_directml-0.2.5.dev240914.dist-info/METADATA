# PyTorch with DirectML
DirectML acceleration for PyTorch is currently available for Public Preview. PyTorch with DirectML enables training and inference of complex machine learning models on a wide range of DirectX 12-compatible hardware.

DirectML is a high-performance, hardware-accelerated DirectX 12 library for machine learning. DirectML provides GPU acceleration for common machine learning tasks across a broad range of supported hardware and drivers, including all DirectX 12-capable GPUs from vendors such as AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm.

More information about DirectML can be found in [Introduction to DirectML](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-intro).

PyTorch on DirectML is supported on both the latest versions of Windows 10 and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about), and is available for download as a PyPI package. For more information about getting started, see [GPU accelerated ML training (docs.microsoft.com)](http://aka.ms/gpuinwsldocs)


## Samples
Refer to the [Pytorch with DirectML Samples Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/PyTorch) for samples. 

## Roadmap
`torch-directml` is actively under development and we're always adding more operators. For a list of all the operators we support and their data type coverage, refer to the [PyTorch DirectML Operator Roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/wiki/PyTorch-DirectML-Operator-Roadmap) in the DirectML repository wiki. If you require support for an operator that isn't in this list, see the [Feedback](#feedback) section below on how to file an issue. 

## Feedback

We look forward to hearing from you!
