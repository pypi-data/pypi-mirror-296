# OILRAD #

dependencies: matplotlib

data: download zip archive from zenodo for Redmond Roche and King (2022)

Scripts to calculate spectral absorption coefficient for sea ice containing log-normal distribution of oil droplets.
Oil types are Romashkino (heavier and darker) or Petrobaltic.
Data is unzipped from archive and only MassAbsCoe folder is needed which contains mass absorption coefficients for both types of oil at a selection of median droplet sizes (in file name) and spectral mass absorption cross section.

It is an ongoing problem how to convert the units to be (1/length) given a mass ratio of oil in sea ice.
