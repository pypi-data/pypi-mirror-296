**Leverage APIs with Unparalleled Speed and Security**


## **Why Swarm Models?**

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Effortlessly integrate APIs from various providers into your projects.

- **Bleeding-Edge Speed**: Experience lightning-fast performance optimized for efficiency.

- **Robust Security**: Built with top-notch security protocols to protect your data and API keys.

- **Ease of Use**: Simple initialization and execution with intuitive `.run(task)` and `__call__` methods.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle everything from small scripts to large-scale applications.

---

## **How It Works**

Swarm Models simplifies the way you interact with different APIs by providing a unified interface for all models.

### **1. Install Swarm Models**

```bash
$ pip3 install swarm-models
```

### **2. Initialize a Model**

Import the desired model from the package and initialize it with your API key or necessary configuration.

```python
from swarm_models import YourDesiredModel

model = YourDesiredModel(api_key='your_api_key')
```

### **3. Run Your Task**

Use the `.run(task)` method or simply call the model with your task.

```python
task = "Define your task here"
result = model.run(task)
# Or equivalently
result = model(task)
```

### **4. Enjoy the Results**

```python
print(result)
```

---

## **Code Example**

```python
from swarm_models import OpenAIChat
import os

# Get the OpenAI API key from the environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Create an instance of the OpenAIChat class
model = OpenAIChat(openai_api_key=api_key, model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Query the model with a question
out = model(
   "What is the best state to register a business in the US for the least amount of taxes?"
)

# Print the model's response
print(out)
```
