# KKRtoVAMPIRE

**_Convert the Heisenberg Hamiltonian calculated with SPR-KKR to the VAMPIRE format._**



## Usage

See `./examples/KKR_to_VAMPIRE_example.ipynb` for the example of use.

Needed output files from SPR-KKR are: `seedname.pot_new`, `seedname_SCF.out`, `seedname_JXC_XCPLTEN_Jij.dat` and `seedname_JXC_XCPLTEN_Dij.dat`, `POSCAR_TORQUE.out`.

The produced converted input files for VAMPIRE are `vampire.mat` and `vampire.UCF`, and eventually `vampire.UCF_cropped_<#interactions>_<crop threshold>` if interaction cropping was applied.
