 Hi, I'm Kyle from the Bose Support Team and here on the Bose Team we take merchandising

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.980
 and brand advocacy to the next level.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.540
 Every visit starts with arriving at the location and greeting an associate by the door.

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.000
 We move on to the merchandising side of our visit.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.440
 We head over to our displays to ensure that they're clean, bright and fully stocked.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.800
 After our displays are clean and bright, we need to test the functionality of these displays. We go

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.220
 through each display ensuring that the demo is functioning as intended. If we

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.980
 run into an issue, we troubleshoot immediately or we call the call center

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.300
 for further support. This can be more in-depth troubleshooting or to order

10
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.400
 parts that are needed to resolve the issue. These can be simple fixes such as installing a wire, swapping out the media card, or even

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 a simple reboot.

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.680
 They can even be more advanced fixes such as entire display rewiring, product changeouts,

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.920
 or even full display changeouts.

14
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.280
 Our ticketing system houses all of our tickets and allows for reps to properly manage their

15
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.000
 market opening, closing tickets, as well as seeing when parts

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.280
 have been shipped or delivered.

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.120
 Once we've ensured that our displays are properly merchandised and fully functional,

18
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.720
 we move on to the brand advocacy part of our visit.

19
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.520
 We do this in several ways, by building the relationship with the store, this is done

20
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.700
 through routine check-ins with staff and management in the field to cover common concerns or questions

21
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.160
 that they may have, as well as fill them in on some new features that they may not know. Training events such

22
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.880
 as morning huddles, lunch and learns, or customized training experiences where we

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.360
 can take a full team sit down and do some in-depth training. Demoing new

24
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.040
 products letting both customers and store associates get a hands-on

25
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.640
 experience with a newly released product and promotion events where we have an opportunity to get on the front line and practice what we preach,

26
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.780
 demoing and selling them ourselves.

27
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.680
 Through these regular engagements, we are able to impact not just a store but an entire

28
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 market.

29
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.960
 This is just a quick walkthrough of what we do day to day here at the Bose program.

30
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.000
 I hope you enjoyed and have a great day.
