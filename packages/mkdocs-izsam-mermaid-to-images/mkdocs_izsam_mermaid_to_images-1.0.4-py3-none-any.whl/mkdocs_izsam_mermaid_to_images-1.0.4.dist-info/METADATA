# MkDocs IZSAM Mermaid to images

This plugin processes each page's Markdown content, finds Mermaid code blocks, converts them to images using `mermaid.cli`, and replaces the code blocks with image references. The image format can be specified in the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

Install the package with pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-izsam-mermaid-to-images
```

Enable the plugin in the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocs-izsam-mermaid-to-images:
      output_dir: 'mermaid_images'
      image_format: 'svg'  # or 'png'
```

# Change log

## [1.0.4] - 2024-09-17

### Changed the way images directory are generated
Images directory now is generated in the same directory as the HTML file where the Mermaid diagrams are declared. This way, the image paths will be relative to the page, avoiding problems with paths.

## [1.0.3] - 2024-09-17

### Fix on image paths
The plugin was generating the image paths relative to the current page, but it should generate them relative to the root of the site.

## [1.0.2] - 2024-09-17

### Fix on image paths
Generated image files are not being found at the expected paths.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-09-17

### Setup bug fix and README changes
Bug fix for setup entry_points section; fix for error in configuration instructions.

## [1.0] - 2024-09-17

### First release
