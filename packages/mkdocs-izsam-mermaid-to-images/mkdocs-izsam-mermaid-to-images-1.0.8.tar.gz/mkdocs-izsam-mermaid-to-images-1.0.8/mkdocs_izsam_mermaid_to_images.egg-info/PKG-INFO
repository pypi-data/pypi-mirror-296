# MkDocs IZSAM Mermaid to images

This plugin processes each page's Markdown content, finds Mermaid code blocks, converts them to images using `mermaid.cli`, and replaces the code blocks with image references. The image format can be specified in the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file.

```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

```bash
pip install mkdocs-izsam-mermaid-to-images
```
