## What is DeSide?

DeSide is a DEep-learning and SIngle-cell based DEconvolution method for solid tumors, which can be used to infer cellular proportions of different cell types from bulk RNA-seq data.

DeSide consists of the following four parts (see figure below):
- DNN Model
- Single Cell Dataset Integration
- Cell Proportion Generation
- Bulk Tumor Synthesis

In this repository, we provide the code for implementing these four parts and visualizing the results.

## Requirements
DeSide requires Python 3.8 or higher. It has been tested on Linux and MacOS, but should work on Windows as well.
- tensorflow>=2.11.1
- scikit-learn==0.24.2
- anndata>=0.8.0
- scanpy==1.8.0
- umap-learn==0.5.1
- pandas==1.5.3
- numpy>=1.22
- matplotlib
- seaborn>=0.11.2
- bbknn==1.5.1
- SciencePlots
- matplotlib<3.7

## Installation

pip should work out of the box:
```shell
# creating a virtual environment is recommended
conda create -n deside python=3.8
conda activate deside
# update pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# install deside
pip install deside
```

## Usage Examples
Usage examples can be found: [DeSide_mini_example](https://github.com/OnlyBelter/DeSide_mini_example)

Three examples are provided:
- Using pre-trained model
- Training a model from scratch
- Generating a synthetic dataset
