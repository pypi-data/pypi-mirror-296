# jupyterlab_server_timer

[![Github Actions Status](https://github.com/isginf/jupyterlab-server-timer/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isginf/jupyterlab-server-timer/actions/workflows/build.yml)
A JupyterLab extension that displays the remaining server run time in the status bar.

This extension is best paired with a spawner such as [batchspawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner). It allows the user to see when the job running the notebook is going to be terminated.

The extension checks for two environment variables:

- `JOB_START_TIME` contains a UTC timestamp of the start time of the job. If absent then the time when the notebook becomes ready is used instead. Since it can take a few seconds to start the notebook the time measurement will not be completely accurate in this case and a hard-wired safety margin of 20 seconds will be deduced from the runtime.
- `JOB_RUN_TIME` contains the number of minutes the server will run. If absent the default is `60`.

An modified example `batch_script.sh` for `slurmspawner` that sets the variables could look like this:

```bash
...
#SBATCH --export=JOB_START_TIME,JOB_RUN_TIME,{{keepvars}}
...
export JOB_START_TIME=$(date +%s)
export JOB_RUN_TIME=90
{{prologue}}
{% if srun %}{{srun}} {% endif %}{{cmd}}
{{epilogue}}
```

## Packages

This extension is composed of a Python package named `jupyterlab_server_timer`
for the server extension and a NPM package named `jupyterlab-server-timer`
for the frontend extension.

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

## Install

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_server_timer
```

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_server_timer
```

## Troubleshoot

If you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check
that the server extension is enabled:

```bash
jupyter server extension list
```

If the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing
the frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```

## Contributing

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the jupyterlab_server_timer directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e ".[test]"
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode
jupyter server extension enable jupyterlab_server_timer
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Development uninstall

```bash
# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode
jupyter server extension disable jupyterlab_server_timer
pip uninstall jupyterlab_server_timer
```

In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyterlab-server-timer` within that folder.

### Testing the extension

#### Server tests

This extension is using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for Python code testing.

Install test dependencies (needed only once):

```sh
pip install -e ".[test]"
# Each time you install the Python package, you need to restore the front-end extension link
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

To execute them, run:

```sh
pytest -vv -r ap --cov jupyterlab_server_timer
```

#### Frontend tests

This extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.

To execute them, execute:

```sh
jlpm
jlpm test
```

#### Integration tests

This extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).
More precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.

More information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.

### Packaging the extension
