# Rdf2GNN
A Python library for processing RDF graphs using PyTorch Geometric, designed to work with ontologies and graph neural networks for tasks like knowledge graph completion.

## Features

- Convert RDF graphs into PyTorch Geometric `HeteroData` objects.
- Process and transform graph data for machine learning models.
- Work with ontologies to identify possible relationships between graph entities.
- Use pre-built functions for RDF graph manipulation and analysis
